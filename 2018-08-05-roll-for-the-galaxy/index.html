              **Roll for the Galaxy<sup><small>Â®</small></sup>**

[_Roll for the Galaxy_](https://amzn.to/2njIiK9) is an dice-building engine + resource
management + worker-placement game for 2-5 players ages 14 and up. The two player rules are
different.  It takes about an hour to play including setup, once you understand the setup.

A child of nine years could easily understand the rules and do the required math, but I agree
with the 14+ rating. It requires thinking several moves ahead, involves some pretty devastating
upsets, and an hour is a bit long for my children to play a competitive strategy game. I
recommend [_Eminent Domain_](https://amzn.to/2OewrYT) if you're looking for a similar game to
play with children 8-14 or a two-player game.

_Roll for the Galaxy_ has many strengths. Simultaneous play means that you're rarely waiting
long for other players, and a lot of interesting decisions can be packed into an hour. Because
each planet brings exception rules, each player has radically different goals and strategy for
reaching it.  The playing pieces are delightful, with lots of colored dice and thick cardboard
tiles featuring great sci-fi art. The dice and random tile draw add enough randomness to keep
you from overthinking the game, but you have a large amount of influence over them and
exception rules frequently allow you to override die rolls if you wish. Most of the rules
are positive, for example, rounding up and 

The game is also pretty to easy to understand--but not from the rules as printed, which dive into
minutae and explain them in inconsistent ways. I wrote this rule book to help you get started.
I give special thanks to Zoltan Szatmary-Ban who explained the rules to me the first time.

Rules Overview
===============================================================================

This is a game where you build an engine to create victory points. Scores will be in the range
30-100 points. You gain exception rules through Development tiles with diamonds on them and
affect the dice distribution, as in a deck building game, by Settling worlds (which has other
effects as well).

The very coarse progression of your engine is moving dice and chips through:

    *Citizenry* ==> *Dice Cup* ==> *Phase Strip* ==> *Worlds* ==> *Chips* ==> *Victory Points*

You will also receive many Victory Points for your *Developments* and the *Worlds* themselves
as a way of shortcutting the core engine.

The dice physically move through your engine (i.e., economy, which is called a "base" in the game).
Different dice will be at different points in the engine as you progress. So, it is important
to pipeline them and keep every stage loaded while also keeping enough dice in reserve to
fill the cup each turn. 

Similar to _Puerto Rico_, _Eminent Domain_, and _Race for the Galaxy_, advancing through the
later stages of the engine requires producing and then shipping goods and it is up to players
to activate the appropriate roles for this to happen...hence, you're often hoping that your
opponents will active the role that you wish to take.

The game ends at the end of a *Round* in which any player has at least 12 tiles 
(which includes the original three starting tiles) or the VP Chip supply is exhausted.
