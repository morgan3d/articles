            **Festival d'Annecy 2018**

The Annecy International Animated Film Festival is the world's oldest and largest recurring
animated film festival (and rolling 24/7 European art party scene). This article describes some
of my favorite films screened this year. See my
[Annecy 2016](http://casual-effects.blogspot.com/2016/06/annecy-2016.html) and previous
writeups.

2018 was a very strong year for shorts, which are the heart of the festival. Programs 1-3 in
competition were all terrific, 4 was watchable, and only the fifth session did I find
unexpectedly weak. I liked the commissioned and student graduation shorts almost uniformly, and
there were several good feature films including two of special note below.

[John Morena](https://vimeo.com/johnmorena) was one of the stars of the show. I enjoy his very
short films as amusements but don't teach or rave about them; however, the consistency with
which he produces good animation is staggering and he had three shorts shown in competition this year
(from the 52 he produced last year!)

_Incredibles 2_ from Pixar, directed by Brad Bird, premiered on the Friday of the festival. It
is a worthy sequel to one of Pixar's best, and good standalone film on its own--this is
definitely one of the best films you'll see in theatres this summer. Jack-Jack is the breakout
star character and Holly Hunter, Catherine Keener, and Brad Bird (playing a female character)
deliver especially fantastic performances. It brings top notch CGI, voice acting, and a
face-paced story. The film's gender and ethnic sensibilities are somewhat mired in the
1950-70's of its characters, which isn't a failure but is a lost opportunity. The central and
long flashing-light sequences were the only unpleasant surprise. They are dangerous for those
with epilepsy and annoying for everyone else. I was a little too close to the screen and had to
close my eyes to avoid a headache and disorientation.


Bloeistraat 11
===========================================

[_Bloeistraat 11_](https://vimeo.com/274061645) (10 min, 2018, Belgium and Netherlands) by
Nienke Deutz was the best short of the festival and won the Cristal for short film. It is a
coming of age story about two female best friends, with plausibly common yet heart-stopping
moments. The animation style was fresh: physical sets with hand-drawn animation on stop-motion
transparent acrylic cutout silhouettes, which let the characters cast semi-transparent shadows.
The camera work and lighting are great, taking advantage of the 2.5D nature of the characters
and the 3D set design. This is everything a modern animation should be. 

My second favorite film of the year, _Gauxuma_, was a nice companion piece with similar themes
but a more emotionally diffuse story.

Animal Behaviour (Zoothérapie)
===========================================

[_Animal Behaviour_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg8y4dKLuWM) (14 min, 2018, Canada)
by Alison Snowden and David Fine is punchy, dark humor with a modern cartoon style. A lot of
films with anthropomorphized animals miss the opportunity to take advantage of the characters'
animal natures--this one leans hard into that concept while satirizing the group therapy
experience. I'd happily watch a whole series on this concept, and it seemed like the rest
of the audience agreed.

Guaxuma
===========================================

[_Guaxuma_](https://en.unifrance.org/movie/45942/guaxuma
) (15 min, 2018, Brazil) directed by Nara Normande. Mixed media dominated by sand
animation biographical film about a young woman growing up and leaving a resort town.
Extremely effective through a light touch and use of animation as a lens for memory.

Strange Beasts
===========================================

[_Strange Beasts_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGWoh0rUvw) (5 min, 2017, UK) by Magali
Barbe was the only short to combine live action with animation. It is a tight story about
augmented reality in the mode of one of the less depressing _Black Mirror_ episodes, intially
appearing to be a Kickstarter video and then shifting viewpoint. I appreciated that it mostly
didn't editorialize about the twist, but instead simply presented a solid sci-fi story and let
the audience decide how they felt about it. You may also like Till Nowak's
[_The Centrifuge Brain Project_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVeHxUVkW4w) (2013) if you
enjoy _Strange Beasts_.

Love He Said
===========================================

>  "In San Francisco, 1973, Charles Bukowski, the underground poet and punk ahead of his time,
>  reads his poem "Love" in front of an audience expecting provocation. Instead, he appears
>  broken and hungry for love."

[_Love He Said_](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/lovehesaid) (6 min, 2018, France) directed by Inés Sedan is a passionately rendered charcoal
animation of a poetry reading. The behind stage moments and audience response captured in the
apparently nonfiction audio give a glimpse of life of the West Coast literate underground in
the 1970s--you can smell the smoke, beer, and sweat.

Biciklisti
===========================================

[_Biciklisti_](https://vimeo.com/260241437) (7 min, 2018, Croatia and France) by Veljko Popovic
was the fun and irreverant sex film of this year's festival. The setting is a bicycle race
and the style is children's book watercolor, but the content is decidedly more mature.

Agouro
===========================================

[_Agouro_](https://vimeo.com/261131330) (15 min, 2018, Portugal and France) directed by David
Doutel and Vasco Sa has a beautiful style for fifteen very long minutes. It has the appearance
of marker drawings composited over oil paintings and a well-crafted soundtrack.

Happiness
===========================================

[_Afterwork_](https://vimeo.com/244405542) (4 min, 2017, UK) by Steve Cutts
hits many of the same points as his [_Are You Lost in the World Like Me?_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VASywEuqFd8) (2016)
short/Moby music video previously shown at Annecy and others of the genre, but has an absolutely winning
moment at the three-minute mark where the animation style flips to underscore one of its main, cynical points.

Ride
===========================================

Paul Bush is one of my favorite animators. [_5 Minute Museum_](https://vimeo.com/136519596)
(2015) is his strongest film because it combines the joy of stop motion with cultural analysis
and reflection on world history.

[_Ride_](http://www.paulbushfilms.com/ride.html) (6 min, 2018, Portugal, UK) combines Bush's
playful aesthetic with a new level of technical cleverness.
The first half of the new film is fun and pretty. The second half is what earned a roar of
approval from the audience, when a motorcycle cruises though a sleepy road with the bike
changing _every frame_ while the sun, backdrop, and rider remain relatively consistent. As with
many Bush films, this reminds me of the core stage and street magician's trick: the magic is
simply that the artist spent an unbelievably long time achieving this effect.

Funan
============================================

[_Funan_](http://cineuropa.org/en/video/355869/) (1:24, 2018, Belgium, Cambodia, France, and
Luxembourg) directed by Denis Do is a beautiful film in a commerical near-anime style of
the personal story of a young woman under the Khmer Rouge and her search for her kidnapped son.
It won the Cristal for feature film.

Seder-Masochism
============================================

Nina Paley's [_Sita Sings The Blues_](http://www.sitasingstheblues.com/watch.html) (2008) is a
perfect film, brilliantly mashing up playful animation, a feminist retelling of the Hindu epic
_Ramayana_, the songs of Annette Hanshaw, and the unravelling of her own marriage. It
deservedly won the Annecy Cristal that year, and was subsequently released unconventionally as
part of Paley's effective anti-copyright activism. 

A decade later, Paley premiered her second film at
Annecy. [_Seder-Masochism_](http://blog.ninapaley.com/category/seder-masochism/) (1:18, 2018, USA) is even
more aggressive than _Sita_, and both more interesting and flawed as a result. Its framing
narrative is an animation of an interview with Paley's then-dying father about Passover. The
themes are misogyny in the Torah (and the era it describes), the replacement of mother-goddess
worship with a patriarchy, and the idiocy of continual conflict over religion and land. The
animation is sophisticated and beautiful, with a mixture of 2D patterns, 2.5D scenes, titles,
and clever animations of photographed goddess statues. 

In this film, the musical numbers all overstay their welcome, but bring an interesting mix of
styles and a lot of solid laughs due to some cynical bite. Paley's interactions with her father
alternate between poingnant and comic, and are among the highest points of the film. A lot of
the film requires some Jewish cultural background to deeply appreciate, and is intended as
self-criticism and inside jokes for that community. Unfortunately, the title "Seder-Masochism"
is too cute by half; it would more accurately have been titled "Seder-Misogyny", but that
breaks the pun. The net thrust of the film is halfway between Sarah Polley and Mel Brooks, but
with a feeling of a single director-author in isolation uninfluenced by producers, editors, and
actors for better and worse.

I found the central theses on track and refreshingly bold, but many of the claims were either
unsupported or oversimplified complex modern and ancient histories. This is with regards to
Moses, idolatry (e.g., arguably a patriarchical strategy against polytheism and mother
goddesses, but the Golden Calf needs a lot of dots connected to defend that), Israel's defense
policies and aggression, terrorism, and an elision between circumcision and animal
sacrifice. In the final reckoning, it is a film that I can heartily recommend as well as
disagree with, which is a responsible place for art to be.
