                 **The _Tiny Epic Mechs_ Action Mod**
        A total conversion by [CasualEffects](http://casual-effects.com)
                        

In
[_Tiny Epic Mechs_](https://www.gamelyngames.com/tiny-epic/tiny-epic-mechs-deluxe),
designed by Scott Almes and published by Gamelyn Games, you put
meeples in powered armor and strap weapons to them. That part is as cute and
fun as it sounds. The movement and combat are weaknesses of
the [original game rules](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Cgyg_wEPXO0_RKSFaihqunjysuA-W7B-&export=download). Gameplay is plodding, combat is a slugfest,
and there's an obvious right choice at every step.

This article describes our house rules for improving _Tiny Epic
Mechs_, which I present with commentary as an educational example of
workshopping game design.  These create a total conversion using
primarily the original pieces. Our goal is to maintain the best parts
of the original game while bringing movement and combat alive through
streamlined tabletop wargaming rules.  The result is a simultaneously
cute and epic experience of fluid battle between elite meeples,
powered armor suits, and a behemoth mechwarrior.

Rules Overview
===============================================================================


Components
------------------------------------------------------------------------



Round
===============================================================================

At the start of the round, all players simultaneously:

1. Untap any *tapped* weapons so that they are face up and *ready*
2. Flip any *flipped* weapons so that they are face up and *tapped*
3. Secretly program, if in Powered Armour or a Battle Mech 


Turn
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Warrior:
- Up to three actions, chosen as you make them.

Powered Armour:
- Up to three actions programmed at the start of the round, plus one
  optional action chosen at the end of the turn as you make it.

Battle Mech:
- Up to four actions programmed at the start of the round.

Players may attack with *ready* weapons at any time during their 
own turn.


### Actions

Actions are chosen from the following list. No action can be repeated more
than once per round. You _must_ perform the move on a played action 
(except for equipping, which has no move). The second part of the action is 
optional.

- Move and optionally Collect Resources
- Move and optionally Purchase a Weapon and optionally Equip that Weapon
- Equip (Use any card, played face down)
- Move and optionally Deploy a Mine
- Move and optionally Power Up

### Combat

Weapons owned by players can be *equipped* (on the warrior/armour/mech) or *in reserve*.
*Equipped* weapons can be:

- *ready* to be fired (face up and right-side-up for the player)
- *flipped* face down, showing that they are cooling down
- *tapped* (face up and rotated 90degrees for the player), showing that they are reloading

*Advanced range* and *area* weapons flip after use, giving them a one-round
cooldown. *Basic* and *melee* weapons only tap after use, so they can be used
every round.
