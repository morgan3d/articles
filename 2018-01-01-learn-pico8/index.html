         **Learn Game Programming with PICO-8**

# Pedagogy

It is fine to change the Challenge when you are inspired by a different idea. Just make sure
that what you make is at least as challenging and uses the same new element introduced with
that challenge. Art works by finding inspiration from challenges and then following the ideas
that develop. For example, my daughter made a car instead of the cloud for Challenge 2. For
Challenge 3 she moved the car instead of the cloud.

You are also welcome to explore and use PICO-8 features that you discover in other people's
programs and in the manual, even if you don't understand them.


# Challenge 1: Face

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ lua
function _draw()
 cls(0)
 circ(32,64,20,3)
end
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


# Challenge 2: Rainbow

Draw this rainbow and cloud.


# Challenge 3: Animation

Save your rainbow program as `rainbow-animation.p8`.  Your challenge is to make the cloud in
the picture move from left to right across the screen.

To get you started, here's an example of a small program that makes a circle move from top to
bottom across the screen. It also cycles.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ lua
t = 0

function _update()
 t = t + 1

 if t > 127 then
  t = 0
 end
end

function _draw()
 cls(0)
 circ(32, t + 10, 20, 8)
end
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
