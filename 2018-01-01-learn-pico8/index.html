         **Learn Game Programming with PICO-8**

# Pedagogy

It is fine to change the Challenge when you are inspired by a different idea. Just make sure
that what you make is at least as challenging and uses the same new element introduced with
that challenge. Art works by finding inspiration from challenges and then following the ideas
that develop. For example, my daughter made a car instead of the cloud for Challenge 2. For
Challenge 3 she moved the car instead of the cloud.

You are also welcome to explore and use PICO-8 features that you discover in other people's
programs and in the manual, even if you don't understand them.


# Challenge 1: Face

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ lua
function _draw()
 cls(0)
 circ(32,64,20,3)
end
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


# Challenge 2: Rainbow

Draw this rainbow and cloud.


# Challenge 3: Animation

Save your rainbow program as `rainbow-animation.p8`.  Your challenge is to make the cloud in
the picture move from left to right across the screen.

To get you started, here's an example of a small program that makes a rectangle move from top to
bottom across the screen. It also cycles.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ lua
t = 0

function _update()
 t = t + 1

 if t > 127 then
  t = 0
 end
end

function _draw()
 cls(0)
 rectfill(32, t + 5, 40, t + 20, 20, 8)
end
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Challenge 4: Music

Your challenge is to play a song!

Click on the music (note icon) screen of PICO-8. Then, click on the left-most square box
underneath the word "PATTERN" to activate the first pattern. Next, click on the right-facing
arrow on the far right of the screen (this means "loop") and finally, click on the tall black
rectangle that is on the right side of the screen.

Now you're ready to record some music. The recording only advances when you play a note, so
your timing doesn't matter.

When you play notes, you use the computer keyboard. The Z key on the computer keyboard is the
note *C* on a piano keyboard. X is the note *D*, which means that S between them is
*C<sup>#</sup>*.

You don't have to know anything about playing piano. You can just hit random keys if you
want. Once you've recorded some notes, return to the programming screen and type this to make
it play the music:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ lua
function _init()
 music(0)
end

function _draw()
 cls(0)
 print("playing...")
end
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you know how play an instrument in real life, then you can use the music
screen to play a real song. Or you can look up the notes for a song on the
web. For example, here's [*Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star*](http://www.true-piano-lessons.com/images/xTwinkleinCtab.jpg.jpg.pagespeed.ic.UCZRJsPtSW.jpg).

This challenge didn't have much programming. If you want to polish it, try combining this
program with your animation from Challenge 3 so that there are pictures and music at the same
time.


# Challenge 5: Sprites
