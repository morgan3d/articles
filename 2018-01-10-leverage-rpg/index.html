            **Rules Summary for the Leverage RPG**
                by [@CasualEffects](http://casual-effects.com)

The [*Leverage* Role Playing Game](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/85727/Leverage-Roleplaying-Game)
is a cooperative narrative table-top RPG. It is based on the *Leverage* TV show and uses a
variant of the Cortex Plus rules system by Margaret Weis Productions. 

*Leverage* has several improvements over classic RPGs:

- Characters start as expert heroes. There is no "first level" adventurer.
- Focus is on cooperative storytelling. Players can make major plot changes, and the game rules
  follow narrative structure.
- The players are going to win every mission. The challenge is figuring out *how*.
- No death, combat is not a major focus, and "bad" roll outcomes give compensation.
- Complete missions in about two hours.
- Play-time character creation through a special Recruitment Job mission.

The rule book is a combined players' and game master's manual with lots of flavor and
advice. It is also a terrific guide to how to design any episodic entertainment, and
heist/con/capers in particular. You could teach a TV writing course from it.

Unfortunately, combining all of those elements in the rule book also obfuscates the actual
rules. I found that players need a consise summary. This article is my interpretation of the
rules *from my first experience GMing it*, which I wrote to help our group. I'll update it with
corrections as we progress and I receive feedback.

To play, I recommend watching a few episodes of the TV show, reading these rules, and reading
at least the flavor and advice aspects of the official rulebook.

*The Leverage RPG is by Cam Banks and Rob Donoghue and published by Margaret Weis Productions.
The Leverage TV show was created by John Rogers and Chris Downey and produced by Paul Bernard,
produced by Electric Entertainment and shown on TNT. The intellectual property is owned by those
parties, I'm just describing the rules of this game.*
