            **Rules Summary for the Leverage RPG**
                by [@CasualEffects](http://casual-effects.com)

The [_Leverage_ Role Playing Game](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/85727/Leverage-Roleplaying-Game)
is a cooperative narrative table-top RPG. It is based on the _Leverage_ TV show and uses a
variant of the Cortex Plus rules system by Margaret Weis Productions. 

_Leverage_ makes several improvements over classic RPGs:

- Characters begin as expert heroes. There is no "first level" adventurer.
- Complete missions called *Jobs* in about two hours.
- Focus is on cooperative storytelling. Players can make major plot changes, and the game rules
  follow narrative structure.
- The players are going to win every Job. The challenge is figuring out *how*.
- No death, combat is not a major focus, and "bad" roll outcomes give compensation.
- Play-time character creation through a special Recruitment Job.
- Ad hoc traits (adjectives) instead of large reference tables.

The rule book is a combined players' and game master's manual with lots of flavor and
advice. It is also a terrific guide to how to design any episodic entertainment, and
heist/con/capers in particular. You could teach a TV writing course from it.

Unfortunately, combining all of those elements in the rule book also obfuscates the actual
rules. I found that players need a consise summary. This article is my interpretation of the
rules _from my first experience GMing it_, which I wrote to help our group. I'll update it with
corrections as we progress and I receive feedback.

To play, I recommend watching a few episodes of the TV show, reading these rules, and reading
at least the flavor and advice aspects of the official rulebook.  You'll  need a few copies
of the blank character sheets from the back of the book to be copied (or just
[download John Harper's](http://www.onesevendesign.com/leverage/leverage_sheets_oneseven.pdf))
and _multiple_ sets of polyhedral 4 through 12-sided dice (put that d20 away), especially d6s and d4s.

The GM in _Leverage_ is called the *Fixer*. In general in this document, "you" refers to a player
and the Fixer is explicitly named. The *Crew* is the set of players. "Party" means either the
Crew or the Fixer, for example, "the other party rolls to raise the stakes". Page numbers
refer to the official rule book.

_The Leverage RPG is by Cam Banks and Rob Donoghue and published by Margaret Weis Productions.
The Leverage TV show was created by John Rogers and Chris Downey and produced by Paul Bernard,
produced by Electric Entertainment and shown on TNT. The intellectual property is owned by those
parties, I'm just describing the rules of this game._

# Character Creation

The _Leverage_ character sheet is called a *Rap Sheet*. It contains the character's stats and a
list of all Jobs they have completed. 

!!! WARNING: A Full Crew
    The game works best with a full set of roles in the Crew. If you don't have five players, then
    add some Crew NPCs controlled by the Fixer, make sure PCs have secondary roles and appropriate
    attributes to fill in the blanks, or have some players control multiple characters.

For a quick start of your first game, just take the
[preexisting Rap Sheets](http://www.onesevendesign.com/leverage/leverage_sheets_oneseven.pdf)
for the archetypes from the TV show and for each player:

1. Choose a primary Role (Hitter, Grifter, Mastermind, Hacker, or Thief) and rate it d10
2. Choose a secondary Role and rate it d8
3. Choose two liability Roles and rate them each d4
4. Assign d6 to the remaining Role
5. Assign dice to your Attributes. These all begin at d8 and must maintain that average. So, to
   increase the die rating of one Attribute, you have to decrease another. Avoid d12s and d4s
   unless you want a bumpy ride.
6. Choose two Talents (p34) either from those printed on the sheets or those you invent on your own.
7. Give your character three Distinctions (p10, p33). These are adjectives or descriptive
   personality types, such as "drunk", "smarter than he looks", and "control freak". These
   don't have die ratings. The best ones should cut both ways. You and the Fixer will
   occasionally assign penalties or bonuses to rolls based on these.
8. Optionally create one d6 or d8 Signature Asset (p52), for example, Nate's Loft, Parker's
   Rapelling Rig, or Hardison's Awesome Computer. There should be at most three of these across
   the Crew for the first Job. 
   
   
When choosing Signature Assets and Distinctions, keep in mind that more powerful or flawless
characters are not always more fun.
  

!!! NOTE: d4 Roles
    The rulebook says: d4 is is a counterintuitive case. You might think it means "I’m
    terrible at this," and sometimes that’s exactly what it means, but sometimes it means, "this is
    is interesting to me." It’s much more likely to generate Complications than other die types,
    so the plot often thickens when one of these comes into play—and with that comes Plot Points
    for the Crewmember.


# Narrative Breakdown


A *Job* is a mission a.k.a. adventure and is usually one play session long.  It is divided into
narrative acts that match segments of the TV show as separated by commercial breaks. The
structure is always:

1.  *Briefing* (p94)
    1. *Pitch*: Something horrible happens and the innocents affected approach the Crew for help.
    2. *Presentation*: Out-of character information dump from the Fixer to the Crew of
       everything the Fixer expects them to research. This can also be from
       the Fixer to the Mastermind followed by an in-character presentation from the Mastermind
       to the Crew.
    3. *Planning*: The players make a plan for the caper, in or out of character.  The
       Mastermind should take a leading role. The Fixer only provides factual information for
       additional reasonable information researched by the characters.  Wrap this up after 20
       minutes.
2.  *Challenge*: The Crew sets the caper into motion but stumbles into a major complication that they
    can’t ignore.
3.  *Twist*: The Crew overcomes the first complication but encounters a much bigger
    major complication. By this time, they’re in too deep to consider walking away.
4.  *Conclusion*: The Crew overcomes the second complication with the help of some Flashback
    Scenes and gets away with the caper. This act is often capped with restitution given to the
    innocents who were introduced in the first act.

The last three are the role-playing portion. They are logically divided into *Scenes*, which
correspond to resolving challenges and usually end with a change of place or time.  Scenes are
composed of *Actions*. The rules refer to Beats in passing, but each is basically an Action, so
you can ignore that terminology.

The Major Complications are preplanned (or at least injected by fiat) by the Fixer. Random
Minor Complications arise throughout scenes, usually as a result of bad luck on the part of the
characters.

There are special Spotlight and Establishment Flashback Scenes for the character-building
_Recruitment Job_ (p45). For your first time playing, you probably just want to get rolling, so
use the precreated characters. When you want to play the _Recruitment Job_, you can read the
manual section on it.

## Flashback Scenes

(p76)

# Ratings

Every physical object, scene description, and intrinsic character property in the game is rated
from d4 to d12. Unspecified values default to d6.  Although higher is better, from a story
perspective anything that isn't average is more interesting to the game:

 Die | Story Impact
 ----|----------------------
 d4  | High chance of complications
 d6  | Mundane
 d8  | Noteworthy because it is advantageous
 d10 | Intimidating
 d12 | "Aw, _Hell_ No!"
 
Beware that ratings can be used against a party in some cases. For example, "Hyperfocused d6"
might mean that a character can perform in the presence of distractions, but it also allows an
opposing party a chance to slip by unnoticed.

Any rated item that is appropriate to a situation contributes dice to a roll, with a minimum of
two always being rolled. More dice don't necessarily increase the chance of success, especially
if they are d4s. Usually only the highest two dice are summed, and 1s always create
complications.


# State

Each player has *Assets* and *Plot Points* changable state. That's it. There's no health,
stamina, spells, explicit tracking of money or ammunition, or complex equipment list state to
track. There are also character statistics that change infrequently, which I'm excluding from
this section.


## Plot Points

(p13)

These are a pun: they are literally points that you keep track of, but also are used to
introduce Plot Points for the narrative. 

You start the mission with one. You earn more as compensation when something goes badly for you
as a result of rolling a 1 or a unilateral decision by the Fixer. You can spend them to make
things better.

Plot Points come and go quickly and don't persist between Jobs, so track them with coins
instead of on paper.


## Assets

These are mostly possesions of the character. They scale from a bust of Nelson you just picked
up to use as a weapon and will toss away in a minute to the mansion you use as a home base for
every Job.  Track these on Post-It notes. Each has a single die associated with it.

Lots of appropriate tools and scenery will be present "for free" in the story and should be
used for flavor but no advantage. Making one an asset gives a die bonus on actions and allows
it to be significant to the story.

*Signature Asset* (p52)
: Semi-permanent, use on multiple Jobs. For example, Hardison's hacker van, Lucille. Spend
  (cross off) one completed Job to create. The first is d8, subsequent are d6. You may swap
  around ratings between Jobs.

*Job Asset* (p66, p115)
: Spend two plot points to bring a d6 asset into the story. It exists for the length of the
  Job, although you might lose posession of it. Example: Hardison's EMP Gun in _The Ho Ho Ho
  Job_.

*Scene Asset* (p66, p115)
: Spend one plot point to bring a d6 asset into a scene. Eliot's tray of Hors d'Ouevres as a
  weapon in _The Wedding Job_ episode.

Players can create assets from anything that you'd expect to find in the scene, for example, a
book or brandy snifter in a private library. They can't produce assets inappropriate for the
setting.

You might be surprised that players still have to pay Plot Points to use elements that the
Fixer already introduced to the scene. Consider Plot Points an accounting device for
tracking events in and out of favor for the characters; and that players are paying for the
privilege of affecting the plot, not directly for gaining an advantage.

The Fixer may occasionally upgrade an asset's rating for one roll if the player is doing
something "unbelievably awesome" with it.

The above are all for nouns. The rulebook uses "asset" and the same rules to refer to
intangible elements (adjectives). For example, making a PC or NPC "Pissed off", "Devout
Catholic", or "Hard Up For Cash" or a room "well-lit" or "noisy".

# Actions

_Leverage_ characters are experts. They can overcome most obstacles with no chance of failure
as long as they figure out a good approach. So, you don't need dice to resolve most Actions and
should keep the story moving without rolling whenever possible.  Dice are only employed when an
action is opposed by an NPC or involves a high risk.

There are three kinds of Action:

Trivial Action
: Something well within the character's abilities and not opposed or risky. No dice required.

Basic Action (p70)
: Risky, or passively opposed. E.g., give a false impression ("Face"), spot something out of the
  oridinary ("Notice"), sucker punch, pick a lock quickly, or crack computer encryption. The
  Fixer rolls to set the stakes and then players roll to beat it. Rolling at least 1 grants 
  the Fixer a Complication (p67) and the player a Plot Point. The Complication starts at d6 and 
  increases by one die for every simultaneous 1 rolled. Failing to beat the stakes means
  failing to complete the action, but does not create a Complication.

Contested Action (p73)
: Actively opposed. E.g., a major fight, hacker battling active countermeasures, con a
  suspicious mark, or playing a poker game. The initiating party sets the stakes. The other party
  then *Gives In* or *Raises the Stakes*. This continues escalating until someone wins.
  The party whose turn it is within the contest chooses to:

  - *Give In*. Lose the action but escape. If the Crew gives in, that creates a d6 Complication.
  
  - *Raise the Stakes* and roll:
   - If the roll is greater than the current stakes by at least 5, that's an extraordinary
     success. You won and the other party is taken down (e.g., tied up and stuffed in a
     closet).
   - If the roll is lower or equal, then you just lost...now you're the one in the closet.
   - If the roll is greater than the current stakes by less than 5, then you've successfully
     raised them and now it's the other party's turn. If they have multiple characters assisting,
     then remove one of their dice.

*Timed* sequences: TODO

(The rules also refer to Flashbacks, which I've broken out above)

For each roll, the Fixer and player select all appropriate dice and roll them
simultaneously. 1's are set aside. The two highest dice are summed and are the result of the
roll. Players and the Fixer can each spend Plot Points to include an extra dice in the total.
