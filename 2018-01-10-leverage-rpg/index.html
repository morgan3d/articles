            **Rules Summary for the Leverage RPG**
                by [@CasualEffects](http://casual-effects.com)

The [_Leverage_ Role Playing Game](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/85727/Leverage-Roleplaying-Game)
is a cooperative narrative table-top RPG. It is based on the _Leverage_ TV show and uses a
variant of the Cortex Plus rules system by Margaret Weis Productions. 

_Leverage_ has several improvements over classic RPGs:

- Characters begin as expert heroes. There is no "first level" adventurer.
- Complete missions called *Jobs* in about two hours.
- Focus is on cooperative storytelling. Players can make major plot changes, and the game rules
  follow narrative structure.
- The players are going to win every Job. The challenge is figuring out *how*.
- No death, combat is not a major focus, and "bad" roll outcomes give compensation.
- Play-time character creation through a special Recruitment Job.
- Ad hoc traits (adjectives) instead of large reference tables.

The rule book is a combined players' and game master's manual with lots of flavor and
advice. It is also a terrific guide to how to design any episodic entertainment, and
heist/con/capers in particular. You could teach a TV writing course from it.

Unfortunately, combining all of those elements in the rule book also obfuscates the actual
rules. I found that players need a consise summary. This article is my interpretation of the
rules _from my first experience GMing it_, which I wrote to help our group. I'll update it with
corrections as we progress and I receive feedback.

To play, I recommend watching a few episodes of the TV show, reading these rules, and reading
at least the flavor and advice aspects of the official rulebook.  You'll  need a few copies
of the blank character sheets from the back of the book to be copied (or just
[download John Harper's](http://www.onesevendesign.com/leverage/leverage_sheets_oneseven.pdf))
and _multiple_ sets of polyhedral 4 through 12-sided dice (put that d20 away), especially d6s and d4s.

The GM in _Leverage_ is called the *Fixer*. In general in this document, "you" refers to a player
and the Fixer is explicitly named. The *Crew* is the set of players. "Party" means either the
Crew or the Fixer, for example, "the other party rolls to raise the stakes". Page numbers
refer to the official rule book.

_The Leverage RPG is by Cam Banks and Rob Donoghue and published by Margaret Weis Productions.
The Leverage TV show was created by John Rogers and Chris Downey and produced by Paul Bernard,
produced by Electric Entertainment and shown on TNT. The intellectual property is owned by those
parties, I'm just describing the rules of this game._


# Narrative Breakdown

The character sheet is called a *Rap Sheet*. It contains the character's stats and a list of
all Jobs they have completed.

A *Job* is a mission a.k.a. adventure and is usually one play session long. Jobs are divided
into *Acts*, *Scenes*, and *Actions* (p68). The rules refer to Beats in passing, but each is 
basically an Action, so you can ignore that terminology.

The *Act* structure is always:

TODO: act structure

A scene is a logical 

TODO: Spotlight scene

## Flashbacks


# Ratings

Every physical object, scene description, and intrinsic character property in the game is rated
from d4 to d12. Unspecified values default to d6.  Although higher is better, from a story
perspective anything that isn't average is more interesting to the game:

 Die | Story Impact
 ----|----------------------
 d4  | High chance of complications
 d6  | Mundane
 d8  | Noteworthy because it is advantageous
 d10 | Intimidating
 d12 | "Aw, _Hell_ No!"
 
Beware that ratings can be used against a party in some cases. For example, "Hyperfocused d6"
might mean that a character can perform in the presence of distractions, but it also allows an
opposing party a chance to slip by unnoticed.

Any rated item that is appropriate to a situation contributes dice to a roll, with a minimum of
two always being rolled. More dice don't necessarily increase the chance of success, especially
if they are d4s. Usually only the highest two dice are summed, and 1s always create
complications.


# State

Each player has *Assets* and *Plot Points* changable state. That's it. There's no health,
stamina, spells, explicit tracking of money or ammunition, or complex equipment list state to
track. There are also character statistics that change infrequently, which I'm excluding from
this section.


## Plot Points

(p13)

These are a pun: they are literally points that you keep track of, but also are used to
introduce Plot Points for the narrative. 

You start the mission with one. You earn more as compensation when something goes badly for you
as a result of rolling a 1 or a unilateral decision by the Fixer. You can spend them to make
things better.

Plot Points come and go quickly and don't persist between Jobs, so track them with coins
instead of on paper.


## Assets

These are mostly possesions of the character. They scale from a bust of Nelson you just picked
up to use as a weapon and will toss away in a minute to the mansion you use as a home base for
every Job.  Track these on Post-It notes. Each has a single die associated with it.

Lots of appropriate tools and scenery will be present "for free" in the story and should be
used for flavor but no advantage. Making one an asset gives a die bonus on actions and allows
it to be significant to the story.

*Signature Asset* (p52)
: Semi-permanent, use on multiple Jobs. For example, Hardison's hacker van, Lucille. Spend
  (cross off) one completed Job to create. The first is d8, subsequent are d6. You may swap
  around ratings between Jobs.

*Job Asset* (p66, p115)
: Spend two plot points to bring a d6 asset into the story. It exists for the length of the
  Job, although you might lose posession of it. Example: Hardison's EMP Gun in _The Ho Ho Ho
  Job_.

*Scene Asset* (p66, p115)
: Spend one plot point to bring a d6 asset into a scene. Eliot's tray of Hors d'Ouevres as a
  weapon in _The Wedding Job_ episode.

Players can create assets from anything that you'd expect to find in the scene, for example, a
book or brandy snifter in a private library. They can't produce assets inappropriate for the
setting.

You might be surprised that players still have to pay Plot Points to use elements that the
Fixer already introduced to the scene. Consider Plot Points an accounting device for
tracking events in and out of favor for the characters; and that players are paying for the
privilege of affecting the plot, not directly for gaining an advantage.

The above are all for nouns. The rulebook uses "asset" and the same rules to refer to
intangible elements (adjectives). For example, making a PC or NPC "Pissed off", "Devout
Catholic", or "Hard Up For Cash" or a room "well-lit" or "noisy".

# Actions

_Leverage_ characters are experts. They can overcome most obstacles with no chance of failure
as long as they figure out a good approach. So, you don't need dice to resolve most Actions and
should keep the story moving without rolling whenever possible.  Dice are only employed when an
action is opposed by an NPC or involves a high risk.

There are three kinds of Action:

*Trivial*
: Something well within the character's abilities and not actively opposed. No dice.

*Basic* (p70)
: Risky or passively opposed. E.g., give a false impression ("Face"), spot something out of the
  oridinary ("Notice"), sucker punch, pick a lock quickly, or crack computer encryption. Fixer
  rolls to set the stakes, players roll to beat it. 1's grant the Fixer a Complication and the
  player a Plot Point. The Complication starts at d6 and increases by one die for every simultaneous
  1 rolled.

*Contested* (p73)
: Actively opposed. E.g., a major fight, hacker vs. countermeasures, con a suspicious mark, or
  win a poker game. The initiating party sets the stakes. The other party then *Gives In* or or
  *Raises the Stakes* by rolling themselves. This continues escalating until someone wins.
  The party whose turn it is chooses:

  - *Give In*.  Lose the action, granting the other side a Complication or Plot Point but otherwise
    escaping unharmed.
  
  - *Raise the Stakes* and roll:
   - If the roll is greater than the current stakes by at least 5, that's an extraordinary
     success. You won and the other party is taken down (e.g., tied up and stuffed in a
     closet).
   - If the roll is lower or equal, then you just lost...now you're the one in the closet.
   - If the roll is greater than the current stakes by less than 5, then you've successfully
     raised them and now it's the other party's turn. If they have multiple characters assisting,
     then remove one of their dice.

*Timed* sequences: TODO

(The rules also refer to Flashbacks, which I've broken out above)

For each roll, the Fixer and player select all appropriate dice and roll them
simultaneously. 1's are set aside. The two highest dice are summed and are the result of the
roll. Players and the Fixer can each spend Plot Points to include an extra dice in the total.
