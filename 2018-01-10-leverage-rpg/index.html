            **Rules Summary for the Leverage RPG**

The [_Leverage_ Role Playing Game](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/85727/Leverage-Roleplaying-Game)
is a cooperative narrative table-top RPG. It is based on the _Leverage_ TV show and uses a
variant of the Cortex Plus rules system by Margaret Weis Productions. 

_Leverage_ makes several improvements over classic RPGs:

- Characters begin as expert heroes. There is no "first level" adventurer.
- Complete missions called *Jobs* in about two hours.
- Focus is on cooperative storytelling. Players can make major plot changes, and the game rules
  follow narrative structure.
- The players are going to win every Job. The challenge is figuring out *how*.
- No death, combat is not a major focus, and "bad" roll outcomes give compensation.
- Play-time character creation through a special Recruitment Job.
- Mostly ad hoc descriptive traits (adjectives/skills/powers) applied with the judgement 
  of the players, instead of large reference tables and detailed rules.

The rule book is a combined players' and game master's manual with lots of flavor and
advice. It is also a terrific guide to how to design any episodic entertainment, and
heist/con/capers in particular. You could teach a TV writing course from it.

Unfortunately, combining all of those elements in the rule book also obfuscates the actual
rules. I found that players need a consise summary. This article is my interpretation of the
rules _from my first experience GMing it_, which I wrote to help our group. I'll update it with
corrections as we progress and I receive feedback.

_The Leverage RPG is by Cam Banks and Rob Donoghue and published by Margaret Weis Productions.
The Leverage TV show was created by John Rogers and Chris Downey and produced by Paul Bernard,
produced by Electric Entertainment and shown on TNT. The intellectual property is owned by those
parties, I'm just describing the rules of this game._

# Materials

Before you play, I recommend watching a few episodes of the TV show, reading these rules, and
reading at least the flavor and advice aspects of the official rulebook.  You'll need:

1. [John Harper's](http://www.onesevendesign.com/leverage/leverage_sheets_oneseven.pdf)'s 
   Rap Sheets, or a few copies of the blank character sheets from the back of the rulebook.
2. _Multiple_ sets of polyhedral 4 through 12-sided dice (put that d20 away), especially d6s and d4s.
3. Counters (e.g., coins, beads, or tokens) to represent Plot Points.
4. Index cards or Post-Its for tracking elements introduced into the game called Assets and Complications.
5. Pencils and note paper.

Maps and other player aids are great, but I recommend against using miniatures and grids. This
isn't a game of tactical combat or other quantitative technical elements. Which is to say,
"Munchkins" and rules lawyers are not welcome. _Leverage_ is about being a creative storyteller
role playing a con artist who has additional criminal skills.

The GM in _Leverage_ is called the *Fixer*. In general in this document, "you" refers to a player
and the Fixer is explicitly named. The *Crew* is the set of players. "Party" means either the
Crew or the Fixer, for example, "the other party rolls to raise the stakes". Page numbers
refer to the official rule book.


# Character Creation (Players)

The _Leverage_ character sheet is called a *Rap Sheet*. It contains the character's stats and a
list of all Jobs they have completed. Look at the Rap Sheets for the characters in the TV show
(p55-60) to get the gist of how the different abilities translate to game rules.

!!! WARNING: A Full Crew
    The game works best with a full set of roles in the Crew. If you don't have five players, then
    add some Crew NPCs controlled by the Fixer, make sure PCs have secondary roles and appropriate
    attributes to fill in the blanks, or have some players control multiple characters.

For a quick start of your first game, just take the
[preexisting Rap Sheets](http://www.onesevendesign.com/leverage/leverage_sheets_oneseven.pdf)
for the archetypes from the TV show and for each player:

1. Choose a primary *Role* (Hitter, Grifter, Mastermind, Hacker, or Thief) and rate it d10.
2. Choose a secondary Role and rate it d8.
3. Choose two liability Roles and rate them each d4.
4. Assign d6 to the remaining Role.
5. Assign dice to your *Attributes*. These all begin at d8 and must maintain that average. So, to
   increase the die rating of one Attribute, you have to decrease another. Avoid d12s and d4s
   unless you want a bumpy ride.
6. Choose two *Talents* (p34) either from those printed on the sheets or those you invent on your own.
   These are special powers that you can activate when the appropriate situation arises, usually 
   at a cost of a Plot Point.
7. Designate two *Specialties* (p30). These are skills that strictly help with your role, such
   as "Driving", "Cooking", "Sports Trivia", "Snowboarding". They don't have ratings, but add a
   d6 to your dice pool when performing those actions.
8. Give your character three *Distinctions* (p10, p33). These are adjectives or descriptive
   personality types that are good or bad depending on the situation, such as "drunk", "smarter
   than he looks", and "control freak". These don't have die ratings. You and the Fixer will
   occasionally assign penalties or bonuses to rolls based on these.
9. Optionally create one d6 or d8 *Signature Asset* (p52), for example, Nate's Loft, Parker's
   Rapelling Rig, or Hardison's Awesome Computer. There should be at most three of these across
   the Crew for the first Job. 
   
   
When choosing Signature Assets and Distinctions, keep in mind that more powerful or flawless
characters are not always more fun.

Create your character according to your story sensibilities. The description will affect the
game in the way that you expect. The Choosing Dice section describes exactly how these
affect die rolls during the game. It also summarizes the vocabulary for modifiers, which mostly
just breaks down into situationally-relevant and intuitive "good things" and "bad things".

!!! NOTE: Liability Roles
    The rulebook says: d4 is is a counterintuitive case. You might think it means "I’m
    terrible at this," and sometimes that’s exactly what it means, but sometimes it means, "this is
    is interesting to me." It’s much more likely to generate Complications than other die types,
    so the plot often thickens when one of these comes into play—and with that comes Plot Points
    for the Crewmember.

# Job Creation (Fixer)

There are some free and commercial
[_Leverage_ Jobs](https://www.google.com/search?q=leverage+rpg+jobs&oq=leverage+rpg+jobs) that
you can download. 

But the rulebook's Toolbox (p121) chapter makes it pretty easy to create your own random Jobs,
and unlike traditional RPGs, you can get away with making up most of the Job on the fly thanks
to Plot Points and player control of the narrative. This is the most clear section of the rulebook,
so I'm not going to replicate it here.

Any _Leverage_ or _A-Team_ episode that the players haven't seen (or at least, won't recognize)
is also a great outline for a Job.

# Narrative Breakdown

A *Job* is a mission a.k.a. adventure and is usually one play session long.  It is divided into
narrative acts that match segments of the TV show as separated by commercial breaks. The
structure is always:

1.  *Briefing* (p94)
    1. *Pitch*: Something horrible happens and the innocents affected approach the Crew for help.
    2. *Presentation*: Out-of character information dump from the Fixer to the Crew of
       everything the Fixer expects them to research. This can also be from
       the Fixer to the Mastermind followed by an in-character presentation from the Mastermind
       to the Crew.
    3. *Planning*: The players make a plan for the caper, in or out of character.  The
       Mastermind should take a leading role. The Fixer only provides factual information for
       additional reasonable information researched by the characters.  Wrap this up after 20
       minutes.
2.  *Challenge*: The Crew sets the caper into motion but stumbles into a major complication that they
    can’t ignore.
3.  *Twist*: The Crew overcomes the first complication but encounters a much bigger
    major complication. By this time, they’re in too deep to consider walking away.
4.  *Conclusion*: The Crew overcomes the second complication with the help of some Flashback
    Scenes and gets away with the caper. This act is often capped with restitution given to the
    innocents who were introduced in the first act.

The last three are the role-playing portion. They are logically divided into *Scenes*, which
correspond to resolving challenges and usually end with a change of place or time.  Scenes are
composed of *Actions*. The rules refer to Beats in passing, but each is basically an Action, so
you can ignore that terminology.

The Major Complications are preplanned (or at least injected by fiat) by the Fixer. Random
Minor Complications arise throughout scenes, usually as a result of bad luck on the part of the
characters.

There are special Spotlight and Establishment Flashback Scenes for the character-building
_Recruitment Job_ (p45). For your first time playing, you probably just want to get rolling, so
use the precreated characters. When you want to play the _Recruitment Job_, you can read the
manual section on it.

## Flashback Scenes

When stuck, a player can use a *Flashback* Scene (p76) of a single Action to create a d6 Asset and
get themselves out of a jam.  The Flashback shouldn't solve the problem. Instead, it should
give them the _tool_ to solve the problem in the present.

An establishment (minor) flashback can be triggered by:

- The Fixer taunting a character, e.g., "how are you going to get out of this one?" and
  the player paying a Plot Point. The player then describes the scene and automatically
  succeeds at the actions in the past.
- Another player character in a scene asking a lead-in question, e.g., "do you have that thing
  I gave you?", and the player who enters the Flashback paying the other player a Plot Point.
  The player then describes the scene and automatically succeeds at the actions in the past.
- A Player paying a Plot Point without any supporting dialogue. In this case,
  the Flashback Action has to be played out as a Contested Action. The events described
  in the Flashback happen even if the character fails, but no longer advantage the
  character. The Fixer has to justify why within the story.


TODO: Wrap-Up flashbacks (p77)

# Ratings

Every physical object, scene description, and intrinsic character property in the game is rated
from d4 to d12. Unspecified values default to d6.  Although higher is better, from a story
perspective anything that isn't average is more interesting to the game:

 Die | Story Impact
 ----|----------------------
 d4  | High chance of complications
 d6  | Mundane
 d8  | Noteworthy because it is advantageous
 d10 | Intimidating
 d12 | "Aw, _Hell_ No!"
 
Beware that ratings can be used against a party in some cases. For example, "Hyperfocused d6"
might mean that a character can perform in the presence of distractions, but it also allows an
opposing party a chance to slip by unnoticed.

Any rated item that is appropriate to a situation contributes dice to a roll, with a minimum of
two always being rolled. More dice don't necessarily increase the chance of success, especially
if they are d4s. Usually only the highest two dice are summed, and 1s always create
complications.


# State

Each player has *Assets* and *Plot Points* changable state. That's it. There's no health,
stamina, spells, explicit tracking of money or ammunition, or complex equipment list state to
track. There are also character statistics that change infrequently, which I'm excluding from
this section.


## Plot Points

*Plot Points* (p13) are a pun: they are literally points that you keep track of, but also are
used to introduce plot points for the narrative.

You start the mission with one Plot Point. You earn more as compensation when something goes
badly for you as a result of rolling a 1 or the Fixer spends a Plot Point themselves, and
when you create a Flashback for another player. You can spend them to make things better
for a single role, a Scene, or the whole Job.

Plot Points come and go quickly and don't persist between Jobs, so track them with coins
instead of on paper.


## Assets

These are mostly possesions of the character. They scale from a bust of Nelson you just picked
up to use as a weapon and will toss away in a minute to the mansion you use as a home base for
every Job.  Track these on Post-It notes. Each has a single die associated with it.

Lots of appropriate tools and scenery will be present "for free" in the story and should be
used for flavor but no advantage. Making one an asset gives a die bonus on actions and allows
it to be significant to the story.

*Signature Asset* (p52)
: Semi-permanent, use on multiple Jobs. For example, Hardison's hacker van, Lucille. Spend
  (cross off) one completed Job to create. The first is d8, subsequent are d6. You may swap
  around ratings between Jobs.

*Job Asset* (p66, p115)
: Spend two plot points to bring a d6 asset into the story. It exists for the length of the
  Job, although you might lose posession of it. Example: Hardison's EMP Gun in _The Ho Ho Ho
  Job_.

*Scene Asset* (p66, p115)
: Spend one plot point to bring a d6 asset into a scene. Eliot's tray of Hors d'Ouevres as a
  weapon in _The Wedding Job_ episode.

Players can create assets from anything that you'd expect to find in the scene, for example, a
book or brandy snifter in a private library. They can't produce assets inappropriate for the
setting.

You might be surprised that players still have to pay Plot Points to use elements that the
Fixer already introduced to the scene. Consider Plot Points an accounting device for
tracking events in and out of favor for the characters; and that players are paying for the
privilege of affecting the plot, not directly for gaining an advantage.

The Fixer may occasionally upgrade an asset's rating for one roll if the player is doing
something "unbelievably awesome" with it.

The above are all for nouns. The rulebook uses "asset" and the same rules to refer to
intangible elements (adjectives). For example, making a PC or NPC "Pissed off", "Devout
Catholic", or "Hard Up For Cash" or a room "well-lit" or "noisy".

# Actions

_Leverage_ characters are experts. They can overcome most obstacles with no chance of failure
as long as they figure out a good approach. So, you don't need dice to resolve most Actions and
should keep the story moving without rolling whenever possible.  Dice are only employed when an
action is opposed by an NPC or involves a high risk.

When rolling, you select all appropriate dice and roll them. Set aside any 1's. The sum of the
two highest dice are the result. You also can pay one Plot Point per additional die that you'd
like to include in the sum. If any 1s were rolled, that creates a d6 Complication (p67) but gives the
player a Plot Point in compensation. Every additional 1 increases that Complication's rating by
one die.

The rolling rules are the same for the Fixer. When the Fixer wants to pay a Plot Point, they
give one from the supply to a player. The Fixer rolling 1s creates Opportunities (which do not
cost the players anything).

There are four kinds of Actions: Trivial, Basic, Contested, and Timed.

## Trivial 
Something well within the character's abilities and not opposed or risky. No dice required.

## Basic (p70)

Risky, or passively opposed. E.g., give a false impression ("Face"), spot something out of
the ordinary ("Notice"), sucker punch, pick a lock quickly, or crack computer
encryption. Failing to beat the stakes means failing to complete the action, but does not
create a Complication.

## Contested (p73)

Actively opposed. E.g., a major fight, hacker battling active countermeasures, con a suspicious
mark, or playing a poker game. The initiating party sets the stakes. The other party then
*Gives In* or *Raises the Stakes*. This continues escalating until someone wins.  Every
additional character assisting instead of taking unique Action contributes an extra die to the
pool. The party whose turn it is within the contest chooses to:

  - *Give In*. Lose the action but escape. If the Crew gives in, that creates a d6 Complication.
    If the Fixer gives in, that creates a d6 Opportunity.
  
  - *Raise the Stakes* and roll:
   - If the roll is greater than the current stakes by at least 5, that's an extraordinary
     success. You won and the other party is taken down (e.g., tied up and stuffed in a
     closet).
   - If the roll is lower or equal, then you just lost...now you're the one in the closet.
   - If the roll is greater than the current stakes by less than 5, then you've successfully
     raised them and now it's the other party's turn. If they have multiple characters assisting,
     then remove one of their dice.

  
During Contested Actions, the rules for 1s for the Fixer and player apply
as usual.

## Timed Sequence (p75)

A race against time, for example to pick a lock or defuse a bomb. The Fixer first declares:

  1. How much time is available (in terms of Actions). The players know this even if the
     characters don't.
  2. What Actions (steps) are required to be completed for success, and what the stakes are (by
     rolling).

The player then starts attempting Actions to complete the sequence. For each action:

  - If you beat the stakes by 5 or more, then you found a shortcut and that Action was completed
    without taking any time.
  - If you beat the stakes by less than 5, that Action was completed and one Action-worth of
    time was used up.
  - If you fail to beat the stakes, then the time is used up but you didn't complete the 
    Action step. Attempt it again.

Other players can attempt to buy you more time by creating distractions or helping out. One
player may make one Basic action between your timed Action steps:

  - If they succeed by more than 5, then you gain time for two Actions. 
  - If they succeed by less than 5, then you gain time for one Action.
  - If they fail, they can't help again for the rest of the sequence.

If you complete the sequence in _exactly_ the amount of time available, then you have to choose
between success and a clean escape. If you complete the sequence early, then you are successful
and escape. If you fail, then you're caught and don't have the benefit of success.
  
During Timed Sequences, the rules for 1s for the Fixer and player apply as usual, including to
other characters attempting to aid you.


## Choosing Dice

The pool of dice for an Action roll always begins with a Role and an Attribute, for example,
"Mastermind + Alertness". You then add to the pool any of the following that are relevant:

- *Distinctions*: If a Distinction (p33) on a Rap Sheet is advantageous in a situation, the
  player _may_ add a d8. If it is disadvantageous, they _may_ add a d4. Except when the Fixer
  has to curb abuses, the decision to include this is up to the player.
- *Specialties*: If a Specialty (p9) from a Rap Sheet applies, add a d6 to the pool. 
- *Talents*: If you have an activated Talent from a Rap Sheet in play, follow its rules for
  adding or including dice.
- *Assets*: Good things brought to the Scene, which add their die rating to the
  pool. Originally created by players paying Plot Points.
- *Opportunities*: Revealed good things, which add their die rating to the pool. Originally
  created by the Fixer rolling 1s on a previous Action.
- *Complications*: Revealed bad things, which add their die rating to the pool. Originally
  created by players rolling 1s on previous Actions.

The Fixer can occasionally specify a situational penalty or bonus on the pool for a roll if
something exceptionally unlikely or cool is happening.

!!! WARNING: "Adding" vs. "Including" Dice
    Dice *added* to the pool are rolled they increase the _chance_ of a high result and
    increase the chance of Complications. Dice *included* in the result are summed at the
    end. They always increase the result (unless they rolled a 1).
