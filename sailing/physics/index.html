                      **How Sailboats Work**
                        Updated 2022-12-31

This is a brief and gentle introduction to the physics of boats moving
under sail power. The focus is on teaching you enough to understand
how to optimize your sailing from first principles, by manipulating
the relevant forces in ways that make sense to you rather than
following memorized rules blindly.

There are many advantages to understanding the physics of how your
boat operates. Although a principled approach requires some up front
learning, I then find it simple and intuitive to understand how to
manipulate different controls, including ones that are rigged in ways
that are new to me when on an unfamiliar vessel. 

![ ](hiking.jpg width=300) Understanding the principles informs your
choice of boat and how you modify and rig your boat. When in an
unconventional situation, you will also be able to intuit or reason
out how to respond. That might be a damaged rig due to a broken line,
spar, or sail; strange wind or sea conditions that alter the balance
of forces such as ice buildup on the rig or; or sailing in close
proximity to another boat during a race which causes new forces to
affect your boat and the air and water.

The principles of how sailboats work are
generally the same across all modern sailboats, from wind surfers up
to megayachts. Sailing is an application of fluid dynamics. A sail,
keel, and hull are airfoil "wings" projecting vertically instead of
horizontally. They create boat motion through drag and lift forces
from relative air and water motion.

If you are just starting to sail, then I
strongly recommend waiting to read this article. Focus on practice
until you have some intuition for the principles. You can read my
[10 Easy Steps](../learn/index.html) guide for beginners to get started. 

Once you understand the gist of the physics from this article, you may
want to read my [novice](../trim/novice.html) and
[intermediate](../trim/intermediate.html) sail trimming guide. A
sailboat moving partly or fully under motor power relies on different
forces. The interesting parts will appear in a future article on
mooring.

To avoid delaying the explanations with a lot of definitions, I define
most key terms as they are used and then provide a more detailed
Glossary section at the end for reference.

Key Observations
===================================================================

Everything about sailboat physics is described relative to the
direction that wind is blowing _from_. This direction is "0 degrees
off the wind" and usually drawn at the top of the page in diagrams.

Sailboats cannot sail directly into the wind, or within about 30
degrees of it on either side. The exact limiting angle depends on the
characteristics of the boat and its sails and trim.

When sailing with the wind nearly directly behind the boat (near 180
degrees), the wind pushes on the sail like a parachute, and that is
what moves the boat. This is slow and avoided when possible.

For all other directions, the forces involved are very different than
when facing into the wind or nearly directly away from the wind. The
key observations needed to understand the other cases are summarized
below to prepare you with the big picture. The rest of the article
explains these in detail.

1. The apparent wind direction over the sail relative to the
  orientation of the boat changes as the boat itself accelerates,
  and does not match the true wind direction when the boat is at rest.
2. Sailboats moving upwind at less than about 90 degrees to the wind do
  not move just in the direction they are pointing. They also slide
  sideways as well.
3. The sail produces lift because of wind motion with unequal pressure
  on each side of the curved sail. This lift force is generally
  oriented between forwards and sideways.
4. The keel (and rudder, and hull) also produce lift that cancels most
  of the sideways motion from the sail lift. This lift occurs because
  of water motion over the curved shape with unequal pressure due to
  the sideways sliding motion of the boat. This lift, and some
  additional sideways drag from the underwater parts cancel most of
  the sideways component of the sail's lift and prevent the boat from
  sliding _too_ much sideways.
5. The above and below water lift forces are away from the center of
  mass, so also create roll torque that heels the boat over.
6. The ballast of the crew, in the hull of the boat, and in the keel
  create an opposing roll torque that provides righting moment and keeps
  the boat from capsizing.
7. The buoyancy of the hull opposes the downward portion of the ballast force,
  so that the boat doesn't sink.
8. The rudder creates unequal drag at the back of the boat, and turns
  the boat by slowing it on one side.
9. The force on the mainsail acts behind the boat's center of mass, so
  also creates some yaw torque. This rotates the boat towards the wind
  direction.
10. When the boat heels, the hull becomes asymmetric underwater and makes
  the boat further turn towards the wind direction.
11. A headsail not only creates increased force for forward acceleration
  but also applies force its in front of the mast. This applies a
  reverse yaw torque that helps the boat avoid turning _too_ far into
  the wind. Without a headsail, a sailboat must use more rudder and
  create more slowing drag in order to avoid automatically turning up
  into the wind and stopping.

A Simple Model
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider a catboat, which has only one sail:

****************************

*                   |
*                   v

*    |  '+-----+----+---'      
*    |__/      |   /
*              |__/
* RUDDER
*              KEEL
****************************

The sail is an airfoil. It is curved like an airplane wing.  Wind
flowing over the sail creates *lift* approximately perpendicular to
the face of the sail, which is horizontal over the water instead of
vertical as in an airplane.

The simplest useful mental model of a sailboat is that there is a lift
force a little closer to forward than perpendicular from the boom, and
the keel cancels out most of the horizontal portion of this. 

Your goals are to maximize the sail's lift force and minimize drag in
the air and water.

To maximize the lift force, first adjust the mainsheet (rope connected
to the boom) so that the boom, and thus the leading edge of the sail,
are pointing approximately into the wind. You know that it is
correctly oriented when the sail is not luffing (flapping) and most of
the telltales (ribbons on the sail) are flying backwards on _both_
sides of the sail. Don't underestimate the challenge of this first
adjustment.  At many Wednesday night sailboat races you could place
well by being the person who doesn't overtrim the sail, even without
knowing any of the other sail controls.

Second, adjust control lines so that all of the telltales are flying,
the ones on the trailing edge of the sail are sometimes breaking
(fluttering), the curve of the sail is deepest a bit in front of the center,
the boat is not heeling too much, and the rudder is not
pressed too hard. The rest of this guide explains how to approach that
more refined level of sail adjustment and how to deal with other
considerations that affect boat speed and safety.

A further detail needed to complete the simple model is that when
running (sailing with the wind behind the boat), the sail produces no
lift. Instead, it is a like parachute being moved forward by drag. In that
case, your goals are to minimize drag in the water and _maximize_ drag
in the air.

Adjusting the sail when running before the wind is a separate set of
skills, which are trickier to master and also involve more safety
concerns.  However, somewhat surprisingly, the fastest way to sail
downwind is often to avoid running entirely and instead push the edge
of the lift mode by sailing at more of an angle.


The Role of the Keel
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The next level of sophistication in a model of how a sailboat moves is
added by considering how keel counteracts the sideways force from the
sail's lift.  See Bryon Anderson's
[The Physics of Sailing](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2883908)
from Physics Today, 2008 for a careful explanation with force diagrams
and equations, or read my higher-level summary below.

The hull shape and the fins of the keel and rudder produce significant
drag resistance against the water to lateral movement, so the boat
primarily moves forward. Because the sail experiences lift mostly
sideways and there is sideways drag, the boat *heels* (tilts) over.

The keel and rudder experience motion through the water with unequal
pressure due to the sideways motion, so they also produce lift. Their
lift is in the opposite direction but under the waterline. It thus
further heels the boat but helps to counteract the sideways aspect of
the sail's lift. Because water is more than 1000 times more dense
than air, even slow movement of a relatively small keel through water
can produce substantial lift equivalent to a large sail through
fast moving air.

![Force diagram by [Anderson](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/na101/home/literatum/publisher/aip/journals/content/pto/2008/pto.2008.61.issue-2/1.2883908/production/images/large/1.2883908.figures.f1.jpeg)](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/na101/home/literatum/publisher/aip/journals/content/pto/2008/pto.2008.61.issue-2/1.2883908/production/images/large/1.2883908.figures.f1.jpeg) 

In a large boat, the keel and mass inside of the boat form *ballast*
(righting weight) that helps the boat to stay upright with these twin
lift forces creating heel. In a small boat, the crew shift their own
weight as ballast.

Turning the rudder directs its lift, and more significantly creates
asymmetric drag that rotates the boat about its keel.

When *close hauled* (sailing above 45 degrees to the wind), the
sail's lift is nearly perpendicular to the direction of travel of the
boat. So, the boat moves slowly and heels significantly. It often _feels_
fast because several slow-but-exciting phenomena occur:

- The sheets (ropes controlling the sails) are under high tension.
- The boat is heeling far over, so the water is visibly and audibly rushing past
- The apparent wind (relative speed of the wind because the boat is itself moving) is maximized because
  the boat is facing more into the wind.
- The tiller (stick attached to the rudder)/helm (steering wheel) is pulling
  hard because the pressure on the sail so far behind the mast and the shape
  of the heeled-over hull are forcing the boat to try to turn into the wind.

When on a *beam reach* (sailing at 90 degrees to the wind, also called "off the wind"),
the boom is closer to perpendicular to the centerline of the boat.
The sail's lift is directed mostly forward in this situation. That is why
point of sail is very fast, even though it may feel slower than close hauled.
There is little heeling. The rudder is not pulling hard because the boat
is flat and the force on the sail is now closer to the center of mass of the 
boat, so it is not pushing on the back of the boat. Without sideways force
on the keel and rudder, the pressure is approximately equal on the sides
and they produce no sideways lift.

On a dinghy, one can even raise the daggerboard/centerboard (a
lightweight, removable keel) when reaching because its sideways lift is
not needed and the small amount of drag on forward motion from its leading
edge is undesirable.

Because the boat is accelerated by lift on the sails and keel, with
sufficiently large sails and a lightweight boat it is possible to sail
upwind faster than the wind speed. In fact, were the boat not accelerated
primarily by lift, boats could not reach or sail upwind at all, as they
are also creating drag with the wind trying to push the entire boat in 
the opposite of the direction of travel.


Sailing Downwind
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When *running* (sailing about 150 degrees from the wind or further,
with the wind coming from behind the boat), the sails obviously cannot produce lift because
wind is no longer running over them. Instead, they operate in a different mode,
which is significantly less efficient. For running before the wind, 
the sails act like giant parachutes and create drag force against the moving
wind. This is very slow, and even with large spinnaker sails, running is
often the slowest point of sail. Most boats can only achieve a fraction of
the wind speed when running, and no normal sailboat can exceed it.

It is often faster to sail deep broad reaches (about 140 degrees off
the wind) and gybe (have the wind cross the back of the boat when turning)
back and forth than to run straight downwind.

The sail angles I gave above were approximate. That is because actual
points of sail depend on the boat, and are defined _by_ the balance of
forces. For example, the definition of running before the wind is when
the boat is using the sail for drag instead of lift!


Impact of Headsails

When running, the headsail is blanketed by the main.

Sailing by the Lee
===============================================================

Not shown in the diagram is *sailing by the lee*, where the sail is on
the "wrong" side and the boom is pushed forward in front of the mast.
This is only possible on boats that lack swept back side stays that
support the mast or headsails that would stall.

Sailing by the lee is [typically employed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y10zGG2nHjs)
only when racing in small boats. It avoids the need to gybe when surfing off waves or
encountering a puff. There are also strategic advantages in
competition. A boat with its boom on the port side is defined
to be on starboard tack and have right of way over port tack
boats regardless of the direction from which the wind is coming.
Sailing by the lee also allows the boat to create or break "overlap"
in terms of racing rules by swiveling its stern at an angle that
would normally be impossible on the current tack.

It is generally not a fast point of sail, so in the absence of these
strategic considerations, gybing and moving off on a broad reach is
faster for most boats than sailing by the lee.

Square Rigged Ships
===================================================================

Once you understand how a sail works as an airfoil, a natural
question is how square rigged ships sailed by the British and
southern Europeans worked during the age of sail. In fact, they
indeed had terrible upwind performance. 

Square rigged ships were developed to exploit trade winds. They sought
to sail downwind most of the time. They could sail the Atlantic in 
a clockwise direction by following the current and prevailing winds,
sailing west at low lattitudes and east at high lattitudes.

On other courses, square rigged ships were hampered by their upwind
performance and could only point maybe 65 degrees off the wind. They
could only make upwind progress slowly by changing tacks frequently.
There were also "jib" headsails, "staysails" between masts, and
"spanker" sails at the stern with more airfoil shape that helped
provide some acceleration upwind through lift forces.

Tacking itself was hard with such a large angle within which the ship
could generate no forward acceleration. They often either gybed
around, even when going upwind, or used a rowboat to tow the bow
sideways through the wind to complete a tack. 

The risk of "missing stays" and failing a tack in battle or off a
leeward coast was a serious liability.


Glossary
===================================================================

There's a lot of terminology for boats. Every part generally has a
unique name. This is important for clear communication. However,
beware that the names themselves vary regionally and sometimes
between racing and cruising sailors within a region. 

The following is terminology relevant to the physics of boats. See
also the glossary in the
[intermediate sail trim](../trim/intermediate.html#glossary) article
for terminology relevant specifically to sails.

Spars
------------------------------------------------------------

*Spars* are poles. A *mast* is a vertical spar and a *boom* is a
horizontal spar that holds out the foot of a sail. The universal joint
where the main boom is attached to the mast is called a *gooseneck*.
*Spreaders* are the horizontal bars that push shrouds away from the
mast.

The *rig* is the collection of spars and lines that adjust and support
it. The *rigging* is the lines.

Most modern sailboats are Bermuda rig *sloops*, with a single mast and
boom and two sails. A *catboat* has only one sail and today is usually
a single-handed dinghy, although a handful of catboat yachts are in
production.

A *ketch* has two masts (with the aft one in front of the rudder
post). These are great for shorthanded and heavy weather cruising
because of the low center of effort and flexibility of sail plan, but
fell out of favor in the 1980s as cruisers adopted a more racing
aesthetic and favored the reduced cost of a single mast. 

A *yawl* has two masts, with the aft mast behind the rudder post, and
is extremely rare to encounter today.

Sunfish are one of the few common modern dinghies with an unusual rig.
Their *lateen rig* has a lower boom that crosses past the mast instead
of ending at it, and a second,
[upper boom](https://laserperformance.com/wp-content/uploads/SunfishRiggingGuide_2022.pdf)
at the top that pulls the top of the sail up.


Foils
------------------------------------------------------------

Keels and rudders are *foils*. They are in fact waterfoils 
(analogous to airfoils), and serve to create lift and drag
forces for controling direction. Rudders provide direct
control over the direction of the boat. Keels are necessary for
monohulls to travel upwind. Multihull boats can move
upwind without them due to the force from their hulls, but
benefit for upwind performance. 

A *daggerboard* is a keel whose underwater area can be adjusted by
moving it vertically through the hull to reduce its force when
sailing, reduce draft when launching and retreiving, and for
storage. Daggerboards are primarily found on dinghies, but are also
used on some catamarans.

A *centerboard* is a keel whose are can be adjusted by pivoting around
the attachment to the hull. These have the advantage that they will
kick up when accidentally running aground, reducing damage
compared to a daggerboard.

In general sailing jargon, a "keel" usually refers to the keel
of a larger boat, which has significant ballast (weight) added
to increase the righting moment of the boat. 

A *fixed keel* is a keel that cannot be adjusted. A *bolt on* keel
has been attached to the hull by bolts that must periodically [be
inspected](https://www.practical-sailor.com/blog/keel-bolt-inspection-and-repair) for 
structural stability. This is the most common kind in modern
boats. An *encapsulated keel* is molded into the hull and 
stronger in the face of grounding or striking submerged objects
at sea, and generally less vulnerable.

A *swing keel* has such balast and it swings up like 
a centerboard for reducing draft. The ballast is less effective when
raised.

A *centerboard keel* is more like a dinghy centerboard. It keeps the
ballast fixed in the hull or near the center of rotation and leading
edge so that it still has righting moment when the keel is raised.

A *lifting keel* is a weighted keel that moves like a daggerboard and
raises vertically. 

In addition to allowing a boat to moor very close to shore,
some lifting, swing, and centerboard keels allow a boat to *dry out*
with the tide and sit flat on the bottom without external support.

A *full keel* runs a significant fraction of the length of the boat.
It provides good protection for itself and for the rudder and
propeller and may have shallow draft, and helps provide a wide slick
when heaving to. Full keels give a more comfortable boat motion that
reduces rocking and pitching. Full keels have lower performance head
upwind and may turn more slowly, and are primarily found on
older cruising boats.

A *cutaway forefoot* on a full keel means that the front begins
midway through the hull instead of at the bow to increase maneuverability and some upwind performance.

A *fin keel* projects downward near the center of the boat like a fin.
These are the standard on modern racing boats and dinghies. They are 
also easier to maneuver backwards under power when docking. 

A *long chord* fin keel is relatively long fore to aft, to increase
stability at the expense of performance.

A *canting keel* can have its angle adjusted side to side. These are
found on some high performance racing yachts.

*Bulb* and *wing* keels shorten their draft by placing a large weight
at the base. Because they lack length, they provide righting moment
from the ballast but have reduced lift and drag and are less efficient
than other types.

*Twin keels*, also called *dual keels* and *bilge keels* are a pair of
side by side keels, tilted slightly outwards to their respective
sides. They reduce draft without sacrificing area for lift and drag
force. They also allow a boat to *dry out* with the tide or be placed
*on the hard* (on shore by a crain) and sit without external supports.
Unlike swing and other adjustible keels, they also provide access to the boat bottom for maintenance in this position
because the hull is not flush with the ground.
However, cleaning and painting between the keels is more difficult
than for fin and full keels because of the reduced space.

Some boats have *leeboards*, which are matching boards or swing keels
on the outer sides of the boat instead of in the center. These are
relatively obscure and appear on some historical boats, especially
from China and Holland, and on sailing canoes. Even more obscure are
*bilgeboards*, which are swinging bilge keels.

Standing Rigging
------------------------------------------------------------

*Lines* are ropes (or cables) on a boat. *Rigging* is the set of lines
associated with the sails and spars.

[Standing rigging](https://rigworks.com/standing-rigging-or-name-that-stay/)
comprises lines that are not adjusted frequently while
sailing and are generally run from the deck to the mast. The most
common ones on modern boats are:

Forestay
: At the bow, pulls the top parts of the mast forward. Some headsails
  are attached to the forestay. Not present on catboats such as Lasers. 
  A *full length* outer forestay runs to the top of the mast. A 
  *fractional rig* outer forestay runs a fraction of the way up the mast.
  On some small boats such as 420s, the forestay is only used
  for mast retention without sails and the jib halyard becomes an
  inner forestay that carries the load when raised.
  
  A *solent* rig has multiple forestays for different headsails close
  together. A *cutter* rig has *cutter stays* or *baby stays* set
  significantly further aft so that the headsails can tack without
  obstruction.

Backstay
: At the stern, tensions the top parts of the mast backward to adjust
  the bend and adds support for boats with inner forestays.  Not
  present on all boats. Boats with *running backstays* have one on
  each side of the boat and they must be adjusted for each
  tack. (Since they run, these are not "standing" rigging.)

Shrouds
: Also called "sidestays". These run from the mast to the sides of the
  boat. Shrouds are not present on some small boats such as Lasers
  that do not have a trapeze or headsails. A few unusual large boats
  have [freestanding masts](https://goodoldboat.com/freestanding-rigs/)
  without shrouds.

There are several kinds of shrouds on larger boats. These
are a combination of *continuous* shrouds that run from the
mast to the deck and *discontinous* shrouds that are shorter
pieces that terminate at spreaders.

Shrouds are named *cap* if they connect to the masthead,
*intermediate* if they connect mid-mast, and *lower* if they
connect below the spreader base.

Discontinuous shroud parts are labeled with "D#" or "V#", where
numbers increase from 1 at those that touch the deck. The "V" shrouds
are vertical and the "D" shrouds are diagonal.

[Names for the corners and edges of the sail]

Most modern sails are triangles.  Some performance mainsails
technically have four sides, although are thought of as oversize
triangles with a bit of the top cut off to get more sail area up high
in clear air. Some gaff rigged sails are true quadrilaterals, but can also 
be thought of as triangles that are bent over at the top.

The corners of a triangular sail are called:

Head
: Top corner, where the halyard attaches to raise and hold it to the mast.

Clew
: Aft lower corner that moves in and out and where the sheet acts for trimming.

Tack
: Fore lower corner fixed relative to the boat about which the sail turns.


The edges of a triangular sail are called:

Luff
: Fore edge between the head and tack.

Leech
: Aft edge between the head and clew.

Foot
: Bottom edge between the clew and tack.

The *roach* is the part of the sail between the leech and the direct
head-to-clew line. The term is used almost exclusively with mainsails.

A *mainsail* is behind a mast, with the tack attached to the mast.
The foot of the mainsail is attached to the boom. In [extreme storm
conditions](https://www.yachtingworld.com/video/skip-novak-storm-sailing-part-3-using-storm-sails-517) on the ocean, a mainsail may be replaced with a tiny *trysail*
that has a free foot. Sloops have a single mainsail.

A mainsail may have either vertical or horizontal *battens*, which
are thin beams of fiberglass that help it maintain a curved shape.

The *foresails* or *headsails* are in front of the mast. In the
simplest case, you're daysailing and the headsail is just going
to be referred to as the *jib*.

If you're racing or cruising, the kinds of headsails you might
encounter are:

Jib/Genoa
: The typical working headsail. Described by numbers based on the
  fraction of J, the perpendicular forestay/luff-at-deck-to-mast edge
  that they cover. A 90 jib is 90% J and thus clears the mast. A 110
  is 100% J, and thus overlaps the mast slightly. Technically, a jib
  or "working jib" is at most 100 J and a *genoa* is a sail larger
  than 100 J. In practice, up to about 115, the term "jib" is often
  used.
  
  Genoas are also referred to by a single-digit number, which
  is generally "#1 Genoa" &approx; 150 and "#2 Genoa" &approx; 135.
  
  Jibs are referred to by single-digit numbers, but depending on the
  boat these can vary from "#1 Jib" being the largest to it being the
  smallest.
  
  On a solent rig, the genoa is usually furled on an outer forestay 
  and cannot be tacked without being furled. The sheets can be run
  around the outside to allow them to gybe, however, if there is not
  a Code Zero or other sail in front of them.
  
  On a cutter rig, the genoa can usually tack in front of the cutter 
  stay with some care.

Staysail/Storm Jib
: A very small jib, possibly on a baby stay or other inner stay.  This
  is for extreme conditions, primarily for keeping the bow off the
  wind when a gust causes the boat to turn up, or for tracking
  straight into the wind when motorsailing.

Asymmetric Spinnaker
: A large, curvy lightweight sail for downwind sailing that is attached
  at the tack to the boat, like a gigantic genoa. Often very colorful.
  These are less efficient than symmetric spinnakers for running, so
  typically used on a deep reach. These cannot tack without being doused.

(Symmetric) Spinnaker
: A large, curvy lightweight and often colorful sail for downwind
  sailing that is attached to a spinnaker pole. The spinnaker pole is
  a boom that must be manually switched between gybes. This cases the
  spinnaker to alternate which corner is the tack and which is the
  clew depending on the gybe. These are more difficult to manage
  than asymmetric spinnakers, but more efficient dead
  downwind. These cannot tack without being doused.

Code Zero, Drifter, Reacher, Gennaker
: Various names for lightweight, oversize genoas-like sails that are
  flatter than asymmetric spinnakers. These are good from a close to a
  deep reach. They are usually rigged on an outer forestay and cannot
  tack without being furled.

Old ships had other sails you will not typically encounter, such as
the "square" (actually rectangular) sails, topsails above the main,
the yankee jib with a very high clew, and downwind studding sails that
stick out far and low from each side.

*Furling* sails can be rolled up onto the forestay, inside of the mast,
or inside of the boom.

The spinnakers and code zero sails are often referred to a "downwind sails".
The main, jibs, and genoas are sometimes called "white sails" regardless
of their color because they are traditionally white and the downwind sails
are often colored.

Running Rigging
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sheet
: Sheets are attached to the clew, possibly indirectly via a boom.
  They pull the clew towards the centerline of the boat and also flatten
  the sail a little by pulling back or down, tensioning the leech, and
  on a headsail, the foot. 
  
  Headsails often have two sheets, one around each side of the mast so
  that they can be adjusted from the cockpit. In this case, the
  *working sheet* is the one that is currently under tension and the
  *lazy sheet* is the one that is loose on the other side.
  
  A *self-tacking* headsail has a single sheet and its clew is
  attached to a jib boom or a traveller. It automatically slides to
  the correct side.
  
  The *mainsheet* attaches to the main boom. On a small boat may be
  adjusted directly ("boom sheeting") from the boom or run to a block
  mounted in the middle of the cockpit.  On a larger boat it may be
  attached in the cockpit, run through a series of blocks on the
  coachroof, or attached behind the helm.

Traveler
: A track with a block on a car, typically for the mainsheet. This
  allows moving the attachment point for the mainsheet from the center
  of the boat towards the side the boom is on. The traveler offers two
  features: the main can quickly be eased by releasing the traveler to
  slide outward, and the main can be pulled down (to flatten it) via
  the mainsheet by positioning the car directly under the mainsheet.
  Not present on all boats.

Halyard
: A line that pulls a sail up. The halyard adjusts tension on the luff.
  There is one halyard per sail.

Outhaul
: A line that pulls the mainsail clew back (out) away from the mast.
  The outhaul adjusts tension on the foot. On a boat with a mast-furling
  main, it also is used to unroll the sail.

Cunningham
: This also often called "the" *downhaul*, however technically
  any line that pulls down (opposing a halyard) is a downhaul.
  The cunningham attaches to the the main just above the tack
  and adjusts luff tension.

(Boom) Vang
: The vang runs between the foot of the mast and the boom. It adjusts
  leech tension on the mainsail by angling the boom down, and prevents
  the boom from riding up in gusts. This is called the "kicking strap"
  or "kicker" in the UK, especially by racers. The vang may be
  hydraulic in larger boats instead of a line and support the boom as
  well as pull it down.
  
  An inverted vang that uses a gas strut above the boom performs the
  same role while leaving more room for crew to pass under the boom in
  a small boat. This is sometimes called a "gnav"--vang spelled
  backwards.
  
  Some small boats lack a vang and must rely on the mainsheet for
  luff tension.

Running backstays
: These connect from the middle of the mast to the back corners of the
  boat.  Only one is *working* at a time, and the other is
  *lazy*. Running backstays must be swapped for each tack, and very
  carefully in a gybe to avoid the boom colliding with one under tension.
  Few recent boats have running backstays because of their complexity.



Mechanical Advantage
------------------------------------------------------------

A *winch* is a drum that a line is wrapped around to make it easier to
tension. *Dress* a winch by running the line _clockwise_ around it at
least three times. Sometimes four wraps are needed for very high
tension lines. Be careful not to let the line overwrap itself or to
get fingers caught inside. Winches accept a handle at the end of the
drum, which is a lever that provides mechanical advantage.  Some are
also electrically powered and can be turned by pressing a button.

Some winches provide further mechanical advantage by having the drum
rotates more slowly than the handle is turned, so that less force is
required but for more time when tensioning. Rachet winches tension
clockwise and have no effect counterclockwise. Dual-speed winches give
higher mechanical advantage counterclockwise. To ease a line that is
on a winch, put your hand over the wraps around the drum and slowly
let it out.  To completely release a line that is not under tension,
swirl the line counterclockwise around the drum.

Many modern winches are *self-tailing* and incorporate a round clam
cleat at the top of the winch. For traditional winches, you must
maintain tension on the line by hand while rotating the drum.

Very large professional racing boats have [pedestal winches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irpD7eABfbc)
where the drum is separated from the handles by a gear and chain
system and the handles look like an upside-down bicycle pedal
mechanism. These typically have dedicated crew positions called grinders.

A *block* is a pulley or set of pulleys. The part that turns is called
a *sheave*. Blocks change the direction of a line. When a line passes
through the same block multiple times, it gives mechanical advantage
by allowing the block to be pulled on using less force but requiring
more line to be pulled through it.

A *cleat* holds a line under tension so that it does not have to 
be held. Some small boats have only one or two cleats, such as for
the halyard. Large boats are covered in cleats for their many
high tension control lines.

The kinds of cleats commonly encountered in small and midsize boats are:

Cam Cleat
: Has two cam (teardrop) shaped, toothed jaws that swivel. Cleat the
  line by pulling it between the cams while tightening. Release by tensioning
  the line and pulling away from the cams. With practice, it can be released
  by sending a fast wave of slack down the line.
  
Clam Cleat
: A valley of fixed teeth that the line is pulled through. Cleat and
  release in the same way as with a cam cleat.
  
Horn Cleat
: These are used for lines that are seldom adjusted, such as mooring
  (docking) or halyards. Has a tapered bar forming two horns, attached
  by two legs to a surface. Cleat by tying a
  [cleat hitch or OXO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LepMcTJuFfI),
  uncleat by untying the hitch. With some practice, the cleat hitch
  can be tied at a distance for docking by flipping loops down the
  line.
  
  Many people tie cleat hitches insecurely, especially in North
  America.  See
  [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBqsF72xNSU) for
  details on the number of wraps based on thickness and the locking
  loop direction.

Jam Cleat
: A wedge with a rounded end, which looks like half of a horn cleat
  very close to a surface.  Cleat by wrapping the line around the
  smooth part and jamming it under the horn. Release by pulling out 
  of the horn. Not as common as the other cleats.

V-Jam Cleat
: An arch with a V shaped cutout that a line can be jammed
  into. Cleat by pulling into the V, release by pulling out.

Clutch
: Technically not a "cleat", but it performs the same function. The
  line runs through a hole and then a lever can be pressed down to
  lock jaws against the line. cleat by pressing down with the lever.
  Release by first tensioning the line and then pulling up the lever
  and flipping it fully open.
  
  Used extensively on larger modern boats to lead multiple lines to a
  single winch. Although you _can_ physically tighten a line when it
  is in a clutch, do not do so as it separates the sleeve from the
  core and puts wear on the sleeve. Likewise, do not release when the 
  line is not under tension or it will create the same kind of wear.
  
Bollard/Bitts
: Single (bollard) or paired vertical posts used for mooring lines on
  large ships, sometimes with crossbars. These never appear on small
  boats, and are only used with small boats when temporarily mooring
  to a ship or large-ship dock.
