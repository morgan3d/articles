Sailing is an eco-friendly way to enjoy nature, stay fit, and have fun
whether through peaceful cruising or competitive racing. I've helped
hundreds of people learn to sail. 

This is my guide for getting started with sailing. It is applicable
for anyone who is able to "swim" free of a capsized boat and pull
themselves onto a platform a few centimeters above the water.  That's
all of the physical capability needed. If you are unable to do that,
then you can still sail. You need to modify the plan to have a partner
whose job is to help you get clear of a capsize and help you recover
the boat. There are special "para sailing"/"able sailing" boats for
people with significant disabilities as well, so that everyone can
sail. For example, the
[RS Venture](https://www.rssailing.com/project/rs-venture-connect-scs/).

The key is to figure things out for yourself at an intuitive level, on
a small boat. If you can avoid it, do not take a course, do not have a
friend instruct you, and definitely do not let a parent or spouse
instruct you until you have the basics locked in. Those other sources
of information are great once you have the basics. When you first
start, I strongly believe that formal lessons and specific advice just
confuse and slow you down.

The Steps
=====================================================================

Learning to sail is a simple process:

1. *Get a boat* and everything from the Equipment section.
3. *Launch your boat* into shoulder deep water and then jump in the
   water (not into the boat). Let go of your concerned about
   getting wet. You are already wet.
4. *Capsize the boat* by tipping it over so that the sail is in the water,
   but the boat isn't upside down. Grab the mast from the water
   and pull. Try not to hit yourself with the mast or get under the sail.
5. *Swim to the "bottom"* of the boat,
   which has a big fin called a "centerboard" or "daggerboard" that is 
   now sticking out sideways. You're wearing a PFD, so this is more like dog paddling. 
   Do it quickly before the boat turns upside down.
6. *Recover the boat* by hanging on the centerboard from the
   water. You don't need to pull yourself up. Just pull the boat
   down. It will slide sideways as it comes up and not hit you.
7. *Board* by swimming to the back and clmbing/sliding in. Try not to
   pull on the "tiller" (the stick connected to the fin at the back) as you do 
   this because they are the only fragile part of the boat.
8. *Adjust the sail* by pulling on the rope attached to the "boom" (horizontal pole)
   until it stops flpping, and then let it back out a little until it is just
   about to flap.
9. *Let go of the rope* if you want to slow down or stop. The boat only moves
   because you are holding onto it. Don't let go of the tiller.
9. *Keep your head low* so that it doesn't get hit when the boom swings around.
10. *Follow the safest navigation strategy*: avoid land and shallow water. 
   Avoid other boats and swimmers.

That's it. You'll figure out everything else yourself by trial and
error. Once you've done the capsize and recovery the first time you
can skip that in the future. If you aren't willing to start your
sailing experience by jumping into the water, then give up now and go
find another sport.

After doing this ten times you'll be able to your boat around and get
back to shore confidently. You will also have plenty of questions at
that point, and be ready to understand the answers. Then you are ready
for more research with online guides and videos, books, sailing
courses, or advice from friends and family.


Equipment
================================================================

What you need:

- A PFD ("life jacket"), which you'll wear at all times.
- An old *single-handed catboat dinghy*, such as a Laser, Sunfish, or 
  if you are very small, an Optimist. It should be old so that you don't
  worry about damaging it a little.
- 8-16 kph (5-10 mph) of wind.
- A bailer, if your boat has a deep cockpit. Lasers and Sunfish don't 
  need this. A bailer is just a plastic jug with the top screwed on
  and the bottom cut off, so that you can bail water out of the boat.
  Tie it on to the mast so that you don't lose it.
- Waterproof sunscreen and a hat, depending on the season.
- A wetsuit or bathing suit, depending on the season. Do not wear
  street clothes. Wear swimming clothes.
- A water bottle.
- A whistle, tied to your PFD and tucked in. 
- Someone to sail a separate boat near you, or to watch you from the
  shore like a lifeguard. They're only there for the rare case where
  you get hit by another boat or the boom and are knocked
  unconscious. If your boat capsizes or you are confused and drifting
  in an unfortunate direction, that is your own problem and part of
  the learning process.

You do _not_ need sailing boots, sailing gloves, a radio, anchor,
flares, life buoy, a large boat, a motor, or a license. 

You do _not_ need to know how to tie knots, what the parts of the boat
are called, starboard and port, the navigation rules, lifesaving
techniques, storm techniques, racing rules, or anything else.

You don't even need to know how to swim, since you are wearing your
PFD at all times.

Like a bicycle, learning to sail when going too slow is actually
harder than when going a little faster. If there's less than 8 kph of
wind, hold out for a better day. If there's much more than 16 kph it
will be obvious to you that you aren't ready for that.

Rain and light fog are fine for sailing. Cloudy days are ideal. Do not
sail if there's any chance of a thunderstorm. You are going to be
sitting next to a giant metal pole that is the highest point around,
surrounded by water.

Don't sail in water that is unsafe to swim in due to pollution,
current, or temperature.


Canadian Regulations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Canada, all small sailboats are
[required](https://tc.canada.ca/sites/default/files/migrated/tp_511e.pdf)
to have on board:

- A PFD. Don't be stupid. Wear it.
- A sound signalling device--that's your whistle.
- A manual propulsion mechanism, such as a paddle. _I
  consider my rudder and my hands to satisfy this requirement
  for a small sailboat. I know many people who strap a small emergency
  paddle to their mast or boom as well._
- A bailer, _which is "not required for a boat that cannot
  hold enough water to make it capsize or a boat that has watertight
  compartments that are sealed and not readily accessible",
  such as a Laser or RS Neo._
- 15 meters (50') of line for heaving and towing. _Your mainsheet tied
  to your halyard or painter is probably long enough. Most small boats
  have 12m of halyard and 13m of mainsheet_.

Boats engaged in a class or formal racing in good conditions and with
a safety boat are exempted from these rules.


How to Get a Boat
=====================================================================
To get the boat you can borrow one from a friend, buy your own (usually
around $1-5k USD or CAD) and transport it on a car roof rack, rent at
a tourist sailing venue, or join a sailing club as a member. If you are
a college student and your school is on a river, lake, or ocean, then
there is probably a sailing club or team that you can join.

If you join a sailing club, they will probably require you to take an
intro sailing course in order to have access to their boat. That makes
sense.  They don't want you to destroy their boat or hurt
someone. Take the course because you have to, and then follow through
with my method. If you just keep taking courses you will progress more
slowly than if you pause.

If you're buying a boat, don't try to go too cheap. If a boat costs
less than $1000 or is on a trailer then you probably do not want
it. Something is very wrong, and you'll end up spending more money to
get rid of it.

There are tons of small boats (catboat sailing dinghies) that are
appropriate to learn on. Some popular ones are below.

- Laser/ILCA, for teens and adults
- Laser/ILCA 4.7 or Radial, for lighter teens and adults
- Sunfish/Sailfish
- Solo
- O'Pen BIC, for children
- RS Zest
- RS Quba
- Optimist, for children
- Invitation
- Hartley 10, 12, or 12.2
- RS Neo
- Force 5
- Laser Pico
- Topaz Topper
- Portland Pudgy

If you want to spend a lot of money on a new boat, the RS Zest and
O'Pen BIC are what my own sailing club uses for solo learners. They
are the most modern designs but are also boats you will quickly level
out of. The Laser is the classic choice for going from learning all
of the way up to the Olympics.

Avoid getting a catamaran for your first boat, because they are harder
to recover from a capsize and more challenging to sail upwind.

Avoid a double-handed boat, boat with two sails, or a higher performance
racing boat. Those all will have too much complexity to really learn
the fundamentals, and will be more expensive.

What Next?
========================================================================

When you are ready for formal instruction, taking classes is a great
idea. Canada's official
[CANSail](https://www.sailing.ca/cansail-dinghy/) Dinghy program has
multiple levels that are offered at clubs and schools on the ocean and
inland waterways.

In the US there is no standardized small boat program, but there are
many great clubs at which to take classes, and colleges often offer
gym classes on sailing to their students.

For larger sailboats, there is the
[Sail Canada Keelboat and Cruising](https://www.sailing.ca/keelboat-cruising/)
program. In the US there are two major sailing programs for much
larger boats.  These are taught at dedicated sailing
schools. [US Sailing](https://www.ussailing.org/education/adult/certification-courses-endorsements/)
has a standardized curriculum and ratings.  The
[American Sailing Association](https://asa.com/certifications/) (ASA)
is a federation of sailing schools with standard certifications and
varying curriculum.

CANSail, Sail Canada, US Sailing, and ASA certifications are only
recognized nationally. The International Certificate of Competency
(ICC Certificate) and International Bareboat Skipper (IBS) are the
only internationally recognized certificates for large recreational
boats, although even those are not universally accepted by charter
companies. 

It takes quite a lot of sailing expertise to reach the point where you
need to think about international certifications, though. If you're a
US sailor on vacation in France who wants to rent a Laser at the
beach, then your credit card is probably the only certification that
you need.
