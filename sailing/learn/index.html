Sailing is an ecologically friendly way to enjoy nature, stay fit,
make friends, and have fun whether through peaceful cruising or
competitive racing. 

I've helped hundreds of people learn to sail.  This is my guide for
getting started with sailing. It is applicable for anyone who is able
to dog paddle with a life jacket on and then pull themselves onto a
platform a few centimeters above the water. That's all of the physical
capability needed. If you are unable to do that due to aerobic
condition or upper body strength, then you can still sail. Modify the
process to include a partner in the boat whose job is to help you get
clear of a capsized boat and help you recover it.

There are also para sailing boats for people with disabilities, so
that everyone can sail. For example, the
[RS Venture](https://www.rssailing.com/project/rs-venture-connect-scs/)
is designed to be self-righting and not require full use of limbs.
Canada also has a nation-wide
[para sailing education program](https://www.sailing.ca/cansail-para/).

The key is to figure things out for yourself at an intuitive level, on
a small boat. If you can avoid it, do not take a course, do not have a
friend instruct you, and definitely do not let a parent or spouse
instruct you until you have the basics locked in. Those other sources
of information are great once you have the basics. When you first
start, I strongly believe that formal lessons and specific advice just
confuse and slow you down.

The First Time: 10 Steps
=====================================================================

Learning to sail is a simple process. Get a boat, learn to recover
from a capsize, and figure everything out on the water by
experimentation. Spelled out in ten steps for your first day:

1. **Get a boat** and everything from the Equipment section.
3. **Launch your boat** by walking it from the beach into
   shoulder-deep water _without getting in the boat_, or by riding the
   boat away from the dock with a big shove, and then jumping in the
   water. Let go of any concern about getting wet or falling in while sailing, since
   you are already in the water. Aren't you glad that you got that out of the way early?
4. **Capsize the boat** by tipping it over so that the sail is in the water,
   but the boat isn't yet upside down. For example, grab the mast from the water
   and pull it towards you. Try not to hit yourself with the mast or get under the sail
   as you do this.
5. **Swim around the front or back of the boat to what is normally the "bottom"**, which is now vertical like a wall.
   You should end up holding onto the big fin called the "centerboard" or "daggerboard" that is 
   now sticking out sideways. You're wearing a PFD, so this is more like dog paddling or treading water than
   swimming. 
6. **Recover the boat** by hanging on the centerboard from the
   water. You don't need to pull yourself up. Just pull the boat
   down. It will shift sideways as it comes up and not hit you.
7. **Board** by swimming to the back and climbing/clamboring/sliding in. Try not to
   pull on the "tiller" (the stick connected to the fin at the back) as a handle as 
   you do this because that is the only potentially fragile part of the boat. Don't try to
   reboard at the side of the boat on your first try. It is harder.
8. Now, go sailing. **Adjust the sail** by pulling on the rope attached to the "boom" (horizontal pole)
   until it stops flapping, and then let it back out a little until it is just
   about to flap around again. This is how you adjust the sail as you move around. 
   When in doubt, let it out.
9. **Let go of the rope** whenever you want to slow down or stop. The boat only moves
   because you are holding that rope in tight.
9. **Keep your head low** so that it doesn't get hit when the boom swings around.
   You'll figure out when the boom is going to move later. For now, assume it is always
   ready to swing.
10. *Avoid things you don't want to hit.*
   That includes land, rocks, shallow water, other boats, animals, and swimmers.

That's it. You'll figure out everything else yourself by trial and
error, and you already know how to handle the normal failure mode of
the boat tipping over.

If you aren't willing to begin your sailing experience by first
jumping into the water, then give up now and go find another sport.
Seriously. You can't learn to sail without getting wet, and it is a
terrible idea to go out in a small boat that you haven't already
practiced recovering from a capsize.

The Next Few Times
=======================================================================
Once you've done the capsize and recovery the first time, you can skip
those steps in the future. Just launch by getting into the boat and
shoving off. You'll be getting plenty of capsize recovery experience
on the water naturally.

I've noticed that novice sailors often launch from the dock,
presumably to avoid getting wet or because they associate boats with
docks. Experienced dinghy sailors usually launch from a beach when
they have the option. They know that getting wet is normal and that
launching is easier, safer, and less crowded on a beach. If you have a
choice of launching from a beach, do so. You only need to be
waist-deep normally when doing this. Shoulder-deep was just for your
first time capsize recovery.

After your first two capsize recoveries, you'll be confident that you
don't need to worry about falling in the water or the boat tipping over.

After going out by yourself ten times, you'll be able to your boat
around and get back to shore confidently. You will also have plenty of
questions at that point, and be ready to understand the answers. Then
you are ready for more research with online guides and videos, books,
sailing courses, or advice from friends and family.


Equipment
================================================================

What you need:

- A PFD ("life jacket"), which you'll wear at all times.
- An old **single-handed catboat dinghy**, such as a Laser, Sunfish, or 
  if you are very small, an Optimist. It should be old so that you don't
  worry about damaging it a little.
- 8-16 kph (5-10 mph) of wind.
- A bailer, if your boat has a deep cockpit. Lasers and Sunfish don't 
  need this. A bailer is just a plastic jug with the top screwed on
  and the bottom cut off, so that you can bail water out of the boat.
  Tie it on to the mast so that you don't lose it.
- Waterproof sunscreen and a hat, depending on the season.
- A wetsuit or bathing suit, depending on the season. Do not wear
  street clothes. Wear swimming clothes.
- A water bottle.
- A whistle, tied to your PFD and tucked in. 
- Someone to sail a separate boat near you, or to watch you from the
  shore like a lifeguard, if you are in a location without a lot of
  other people around. They're only there for true emergencies,
  such as if you are struck by another boat. They shouldn't help if
  your boat capsizes normally, or if you are simply you are confused
  and drifting in an unfortunate direction. Mistakes that do not
  threaten injury are your own problem and part of the learning
  process.

You do _not_ need sailing boots, sailing gloves, a radio, anchor,
flares, life buoy, a large boat, a motor, or a license. 

You do _not_ need to know how to tie knots, what the parts of the boat
are called, starboard and port, the navigation rules, lifesaving
techniques, storm techniques, racing rules, or anything else.

You don't even need to know how to swim, since you are wearing your
PFD at all times.

Like a bicycle, learning to sail when going too slow is actually
harder than when going a little faster. If there's less than 8 kph of
wind, hold out for a better day. If there's much more than 16 kph it
will be obvious to you that you aren't ready for that.

Rain and light fog are fine for sailing. Cloudy days are ideal. Do not
sail if there's any chance of a thunderstorm. You are going to be
sitting next to a giant metal pole that is the highest point around,
surrounded by water.

Don't sail in water that is unsafe to swim in due to pollution,
current, or temperature.


Canadian Regulations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Canada, all small sailboats are
[required](https://tc.canada.ca/sites/default/files/migrated/tp_511e.pdf)
to have on board:

- A PFD. Don't be stupid. Wear it.
- A sound signalling device--that's your whistle.
- A manual propulsion mechanism, such as a paddle. _I
  consider my rudder and my hands to satisfy this requirement
  for a small sailboat. I know many people who strap a small emergency
  paddle to their mast or boom as well._
- A bailer, _which is "not required for a boat that cannot
  hold enough water to make it capsize or a boat that has watertight
  compartments that are sealed and not readily accessible",
  such as a Laser or RS Neo._
- 15 meters (50') of line for heaving and towing. _Your mainsheet tied
  to your halyard or painter is probably long enough. Most small boats
  have 12m of halyard and 13m of mainsheet_.

Boats engaged in a class or formal racing in good conditions and with
a safety boat are exempted from these rules.


How to Get a Boat
=====================================================================
To get the boat you can borrow one from a friend, buy your own (usually
around $1-5k USD or CAD) and transport it on a car roof rack, rent at
a tourist sailing venue, or join a sailing club as a member. If you are
a college student and your school is on a river, lake, or ocean, then
there is probably a sailing club or team that you can join.

If you join a sailing club, they will probably require you to take an
intro sailing course in order to have access to their boat. That makes
sense. They don't want you to destroy their boat or hurt someone. So,
take the course because you have to. Then, then forget all of the
rules and theory you've half-learned. Follow through with my method
until sailing makes some sense intuitively and physically. If you
start with a course and just keep taking courses, then you likely will
progress more slowly. Pause and fool around a lot and learn on your
own through mistakes.

If you're buying a boat, don't try to go too cheap. If a boat costs
less than $1000 or is on a trailer then you probably do not want
it. 

Also do not go too expensive. If a boat is expensive because it is
high-end, then it has lots of features that will complicate the
learning process and it is likely less stable--you would not want to
learn to drive in a race car, so don't learn to sail in a racing
boat. Or, an expensive boat might be so because it is in great
condition, and then you will be too afraid of damaging the boat to
make the mistakes needed for learning. Regardless, you will outgrow
this boat and want a nicer, and maybe larger, one after a year or
two. So, don't over-invest in your first boat.

There are tons of single-sail dinghies that are appropriate to learn
on. Some popular ones are below.

- [Laser/ILCA](http://www.laserinternational.org/), for large teens and adults
- [Laser/ILCA](http://www.laserinternational.org/) 4.7 or Radial, for lighter teens and adults
- [Sunfish](https://laserperformance.com/boats/sunfish/)/Sailfish
- [O'Pen Skiff](https://www.openskiff.org/), for children
- [RS Neo](w.rssailing.com/project/rs-neo/)
- [RS Zest](https://www.rssailing.com/project/rs-zest/)
- [RS Quba](https://www.sailaction.com/rs-quba)
- [Optimist](https://www.optican.org/), for children
- [Solo](https://www.solosailing.org.uk/)
- [Invitation](https://www.sailrite.com/Bombardier-Invitation-Sail-Data)
- [Hartley](https://www.hartleyboats.com/) 10, 12, or 12.2
- [Force 5](http://www.force5sailboats.com/)
- [Sabot]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabot_(dinghy)")
- [Europe](https://sailboatdata.com/sailboat/europe-international)
- [Laser Pico](https://sailboatdata.com/sailboat/laser-pico)
- [Topper Topaz](https://www.topazsailboats.com/)
- [Portland Pudgy](https://portlandpudgy.com/)
- [Byte]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(dinghy)"), for teens or small adults

If you want to spend a lot of money on a new boat, the RS Zest and
O'Pen BIC are what my own sailing club uses for solo learners. They
are the most modern designs but are also boats you will quickly level
out of. The Laser is the classic choice for going from learning all
of the way up to the Olympics.

Avoid getting a catamaran for your first boat, because they are harder
to recover from a capsize and more challenging to sail upwind.

Avoid a double-handed boat, boat with two sails, or a higher performance
racing boat. Those all will have too much complexity to really learn
the fundamentals, and will be more expensive.

What Next?
========================================================================

Once you have figured out the basics on your own, taking a sailing
course _is_ a great idea. 

Canada's official
[CANSail](https://www.sailing.ca/cansail-dinghy/) Dinghy program has
multiple levels that are offered at clubs and schools on the ocean and
inland waterways.

In the UK, the [RYA Dinghy](https://www.rya.org.uk/training/small-boat-sailing/dinghy)
National Sailing Scheme covers small boats from beginnings through advanced racing
techniques.

In the US there is no standardized small boat program, but there are
many great clubs at which to take classes, and colleges often offer
gym classes on sailing to their students.

For larger sailboats, there is the
[Sail Canada Keelboat and Cruising](https://www.sailing.ca/keelboat-cruising/)
program. In the US there are two major sailing programs for much
larger boats.  These are taught at dedicated sailing
schools. [US Sailing](https://www.ussailing.org/education/adult/certification-courses-endorsements/)
has a standardized curriculum and ratings.  The
[American Sailing Association](https://asa.com/certifications/) (ASA)
is a federation of sailing schools with standard certifications and
varying curriculum.

CANSail, Sail Canada, US Sailing, and ASA certifications are only
recognized nationally. The International Certificate of Competency
(ICC Certificate) and International Bareboat Skipper (IBS) are the
only internationally recognized certificates for large recreational
boats, although even those are not universally accepted by charter
companies. 

It takes quite a lot of sailing expertise to reach the point where you
need to think about international certifications, though. If you're a
US sailor on vacation in France who wants to rent a Laser at the
beach, then your credit card is probably the only certification that
you need.
