Boats communicate by VHF radio on marine channels, at either
1 W power locally or 25 W for maximum range. It has an
effective range at 25 W of
[5-20 NM](https://www.offshoreblue.com/comms/vhf-capabilities.php)
(around 10-35 km) for unobstructed line of line of sight between
antennas mounted high on masts. Marine VHF use includes recreational,
commercial, and military use, so it allows boats and land stations
from different categories to coordinate safely.

Not covered in this article, boats _also_ communicate by cellular
phone (when in range of land antennas), satellite phone, satellite
internet, marine SSB/UHF radio, and ham radio, as well as employing
various emergency transmitters.

General voice VHF is an unencrypted broadcast transmission.  Anyone
with a VHF radio can hear everyone's transmissions in range, and only
one station can broadcast at a time. Channels and protocols are
therefore tightly regulated. Their proper use must be observed for
effective and legal use of this critical safety and communication
resource.

_This article is a reference guide for marine VHF use. It is not
authoritative on protocols or intended as a sole safety guide, and may
have errors or omissions. You have sole responsibility for verifying
information here and I assume no liability and provide no
warranty. Check your local laws for licensing requirements and
additional regulations. Note that even listening to marine VHF without
a license is illegal in some jurisdictions._


Controlling Station
=============================================================================
A *station* is a specific radio, which can be installed on a boat,
carried as handheld by a person, or installed on shore.

The receiver of a call is the *controlling* station, except for distress
(mayday) calls, where the vessel in distress is the controlling station.


Emergency Transmissions
=============================================================================
The *priority* of transmissions is Distress overrides Urgency
overrides Safety overrides Routine.

An emergency transmission sequence begins with a voice *call* and is
followed by a voice *message*. These are often combined into a single 
transmission.

A DSC *alert* may also be issued before the voice call. 

Each voice transmission begins with a *signal*, such as "Mayday".

Safety (Sécurité)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Safety messages are usually sent by the Coast Guard or large ships.
Broadcast the call on channel 16:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sécurité, sécurité, sécurité
All stations, all stations, all stations (or rarely, a specific station)
This is (vessel), (vessel), (vessel)
Call sign (call sign)
MMSI number (number)

My position is (latitude),  (longitude), (+ location relative to some landmark)

I will broadcast a navigation warning about (summary) on channel (working channel) (or include here if short).

out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Then, broadcast the message on the working channel, such as 06:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sécurité, sécurité, sécurité
All stations, all stations, all stations (or rarely, a specific station)
This is (vessel), (vessel), (vessel)
Call sign (call sign)
MMSI number (number)

My position is (latitude), (longitude), (+ location relative to some landmark)

(nature of the navigation hazard)

over
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The message can be combined with the call in a single transmission
when short.

It is unusual to send a DSC alert for a safety
message. That is only done when a large area is affected.



\newpage
Urgency (Pan-Pan)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(_Pronounced "pahn-pahn"_)

On channel 16:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pan-pan, pan-pan, pan-pan

This is (vessel), (vessel), (vessel)
Call sign (call sign)
MMSI number (number)

My position is (latitude), (longitude), (+ location relative to some landmark)

(nature of the urgency)

I have (n) persons aboard

(relevant identifying details for the boat, course and speed, etc.)

over
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Continue monitoring for three minutes after _receiving_ an urgency call.


\newpage
Distress (Mayday)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

On channel 16:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mayday, mayday, mayday
This is (vessel), (vessel), (vessel)
Call sign (call sign)
MMSI number (number)


Mayday
My position is (latitude), (longitude), (+ location relative to some landmark)

(nature of the distress)

(the assistance that is required)

I have (n) persons aboard

(relevant identifying details for the boat)

(course and speed)

over
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every following message should begin with `Mayday (vessel)`.


Respond to a mayday call with:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mayday 
(distressed vessel), (distressed vessel), (distressed vessel)
This is (vessel), (vessel), (vessel)

Received mayday

...

Over
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


If other traffic is not respecting the mayday and still transmitting,
the controlling station can explicitly impose silence with:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none
(offending transmitter)
This is (vessel)

Silence Mayday ("Seelonce mayday")

Out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


If other traffic is not respecting the mayday and still transmitting,
a third party station can explicitly impose silence with:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none
(offending transmitter)
This is (vessel)

Silence distress ("Seelonce distress")

Out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


End mayday with:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none
Mayday (vessel)

Silence fini ("Seelonce feenee")

Out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


\newpage
Distress Relay (Mayday Relay)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

On channel 16:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MMSI number (number)


Mayday received from (vessel) at (time/date):
Their position is (latitude), (longitude), (+ location relative to some landmark)

(the nature of their distress)
(the assistance that is required)

They have (n) persons aboard

(relevant identifying details for the boat, course and speed, etc.)

Go to working channel (channel, e.g. 68)

Over
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Messages:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none

...

Over
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


End:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(other vessel) this is (my vessel)
...

Returning to channel 16

Out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

US and Canada Licensing
=============================================================================

Operating a VHF radio in Canadian waters requires a
[Restricted Operator Certificate-Maritime (ROC-M)](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/015.nsf/eng/h_00005.html),
which is issued by
[Canadian Power and Sail Squadrons](https://www.cps-ecp.ca/).
Operating includes even just turning the radio on. The ROC-M is
restricted to operation on water for non-commercial vessels.

In Canada, a VHF station license is _not_ required for a radio mounted in a
vessel. [It is required for a Canadian vessel in US waters](https://www.sailing.ca/rocm/#). That 
station license is issued by
[Innovation Canada](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/learn-more/key-documents/forms/ic-3020-application-maritime-mobile-radio-station-licence).

Operating a VHF radio in US waters for a US recreational vessel
does not require a license.

Without a land station license, it is illegal in most countries to
transmit on VHF from land. Marine stations may only use marine
channels.

The channels used vary by country.
