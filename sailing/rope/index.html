         **Essential Rope Techniques for Boating**
                         Updated 2022-12-31


This article describes the essential knots and other rope handling
techniques for recreational boating. Despite the common perception,
you really do not need to know how to tie many knots to begin to
contribute effectively on a boat. That even includes not even
needing the famous bowline knot at first!

width=350px) Ropes are usually called "lines" on a boat. Surprisingly,
two of the most useful line handling skills are ones that many
experienced sailors still perform incorrectly: coiling, and hitching
to a cleat. You can level up your nautical expertise and be a great
asset on board any boat by learning to perform these two
properly. They are guaranteed to arise on every sail, and are
something the skipper is often not able to do personally while at the
helm and so appreciates the help with. 

Once you can perform coiling and cleating, add a few key knots and
other techniques. The set of skills for everyday boating is
surprisingly small. In this article, I call out twelve line handling
skills that are sufficient to take you through years of boating and
intermediate level sailing in particular. 

Of course, interesting knots and other rope techniques are themselves
a fascinating subject for many people. There is no reason to stop at
only the essentials if you are one of those people yourself.


The Techniques
=====================================================================

Below are the basic line handling skills for boating. I prioritize
mastering them in this order, based on how helpful they are to have
crew know. 

For example, you're going to operate a winch at least ten or twenty
times a day on a mid-sided sailboat. So, that is a high priority to
learn. In contrast, you will likely only tie at most two stopper knots
that day, and the skipper could do that themselves. You'll still need
to know to tie the stopper if you _are_ the skipper, so the stopper
still makes the essentials list near at the bottom.


[Winch operation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaC8V8ecdpw) 
: ![ ](winch.jpg alt="Public domain from https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/es/view-image.php?image=434883" width=200px) Needed for tensioning halyards, sheets, and outhauls. This is only 
  essential for keelboats, as powerboats and dinghies don't have these
  kinds of winches. Proper winch operation is as much about not injuring
  your hands or back as treating the boat well.
  

[Cleat hitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBqsF72xNSU)
: Needed for docking, and some halyards and outhauls. For docking,
  note: begin around the far cleat horn, make one or more full wraps
  at the base depending on the relative size of the line and cleat,
  and finishing with the locking hitch.

[Coiling a line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX4Zr0vdGHE&t=189s)
: Needed for storing lines on the boat. The linked video shows the
  figure 8 coil, which I find easiest to teach and perform reliably.
  [Another method]((https://www.animatedknots.com/coil-unattached-rope-knot)
  involves alternately twisting each coil in opposite directions, which works
  equally well except that many people forget the _alternating_ part,
  and then have a pretty coil that kinks and binds when the line
  later runs out.
 
[Round turn and two half hitches](https://eoceanic.com/sailing/tips/16/135/a_very_useful_general_purpose_knot_the_round_turn_and_two_half_hitches/) (RT2HH)
: ![ ](rt2hh.png alt="CC SA 3.0 from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Roringstek.png" width=200px) For tying
  fenders to a lifeline, docking to a post or ring, attaching an
  anchor to the rode, and fastening anything to a pole, bar, or
  ring. Prefer it to a bowline when you have to tie or release under
  tension, or need a tight wrap.
  This knot is just a full wrap plus a clove hitch. It can be finished
  with extra half hitches to further prevent slipping or take up extra 
  line on the working end.

[Throwing a line](https://www.boatus.com/expert-advice/expert-advice-archive/2014/june/how-to-throw-a-line-properly)
: This is how to get a line to someone on another boat or a dock
  without it going in the water or hitting them in the face.

[Flemish coil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJsKcGFx1c8)
: ![ ](flemish-coil.jpg width=200px alt="CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 from https://www.flickr.com/photos/lwr/8692344636") Needed for storing mooring line tails on a dock.

[Rolling hitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVOR9lOaEQg)
: Needed for anchor snubbers and clearing a jammed winch.

[Trucker's hitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raTYwsfnsXg)
: This uses a rolling hitch and a slip knot. It is needed for
  attaching a small boat to a trailer or roof rack, or tying down a
  boat cover.

[Bowline](https://www.animatedknots.com/bowline-knot)
: ![ ](bowline.jpg width=200px alt="CC BY 2.0 from https://www.flickr.com/photos/58827557@N06/51521719787")Needed for attaching sheets to a sail clew, tying on a dinghy
  painter, tying around a person or as a foot loop for a rescue, and
  generally is the go-to and overused sailing knot.

[Figure 8](https://www.animatedknots.com/figure-8-knot) (Flemish knot)
: Stopper knot that is easily untied, good for the ends of sheets.

[Double overhand](https://www.animatedknots.com/double-overhand-stopper-knot)
: Stopper knot that is more permanent than a figure 8. Good for
  halyards as a stopper at the bottom, or for stopping the
  ball at the top of a dinghy halyard.
 
[Dinghy halyard ball attachment](halyard-ball.png)
: This method replaced the traditional
  [studding sail halyard bend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukxwS8RrJxg).
  If you have a dinghy that doesn't use a ball on the halyard, I
  recommend attaching one. This method saves a few centimeters
  at the top of the halyard and is and easier to tie and
  untie.

Key points to know about knots:

- Knots weaken lines by as much as 50%. The line will break at the
  knot, not in the middle of the tensioned line. For strength,
  permanent attachments are spliced in lines or sewn in webbing
  instead of tied. Existing loops are
  [best linked](https://www.animatedknots.com/girth-hitch-knot) by
  shackles instead of knots.
- Tying more knots in a line rarely makes a better hold, and
  definitely makes it harder to untie. The exception is that
  some knots in slipperier ropes benefit from finishing with
  a few half hitches.
- Modern synthetic lines do not hold knots as well as traditional
  lines. Most knots will [slip easily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7gI4YF0D2Y) in something like an unsleeved
  dyneema/spectra line. Even modern three-braid and sleeved
  lines have much less friction than tarred hemp, so beware
  of knot information that is more than 20 years old.


Vocabulary
=====================================================================

Some general rope vocabulary, mostly for fun because this isn't
essential in practice:

[Working end](https://www.netknots.com/rope_knots/rope-knot-terms)
: The free end of a line used to tie a knot.

[Standing part](https://www.netknots.com/rope_knots/rope-knot-terms)
: The part of the line attached to something else, so not available
  to manipulate for tying a knot.
  
[Bight](https://www.netknots.com/rope_knots/rope-knot-terms)
: Some part of the middle of a rope. This is used when referring to
  tying a knot "on a bight", meaning without a working end available.

Lazy line
: A line that is not currently in use or under tension because some
  partner rope on the other side is under tension. Frequently
  used for the sheets, the lines attached to the jib sail, and running
  backstays, which are lines that support and tension the mast.

Working line
: A line that is under tension.

[Bitter end](https://www.grammar-monster.com/sayings_proverbs/bitter_end.htm)
: The end of the anchor line that is tied to the boat.

Sleeve
: The woven covering providing UV protection and friction on a modern line.

Core
: The interior of a modern line, which provides the strength.

I cover the names of specific lines for sailing and mooring in my
other guides. They aren't "essential", either. In cases where you need
to know that, you're with someone and they will clarify, such as "the
big red rope on the left side of the boat"; you are by yourself and
don't need to know the name; or you are reading and have time to look
it up.


Next Steps
=====================================================================

This guide for rope essentials is of course only the beginning of rope
techniques employed on boats, although it covers 99% of daily
use. There's a wonderful world of knots for all kinds of line and
purposes to learn after these. 

I use maybe another ten knots occasionally for specific purposes,
including the
[slip knot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnkth1n_2A),
[double fisherman bend](https://www.animatedknots.com/double-fishermans-bend-knot),
[halyard hitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEEYkfINomY),
[cow hitch/lark's head](https://www.animatedknots.com/cow-hitch-knot-end-method),
[sheet bend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MITXMnu8jo8), and
[reef (square) knot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y_iorha2k4). 

Line maintenance skills such as 
[splicing](https://www.animatedknots.com/short-splice-knot), 
[eye splicing](https://www.animatedknots.com/eye-splice-knot), 
[fusing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op4yhe3Hbno),
and [whipping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZCXhdzvQrU) are essential for boat maintenance and likely more
important than learning most esoteric knots, which are of more
aesthetic and historical interest than practical use.

If you _must_ tie knots in unsleeved dyneema/spectra, two knots
that Evans Starzinger developed and recommends are:

- [EStar Hitch](https://www.animatedknots.com/images/estar_hitch.gif)
- [EStar Stopper](https://www.animatedknots.com/estar-stopper-knot)

These can still slip, though--prefer splicing.

Some interesting sources for going down the rabbit hole on
knots are:

- [Animated Knots by Grog](https://www.animatedknots.com/)
- [The Ashley Book of Knots](https://www.liendoanaulac.org/space/references/training/Ashley_Book_Knots.pdf)
- [International Guild of Knot Tyers Forum](https://forum.igkt.net/index.php)

Beware that all of them have information that may sound authoritative
but in practice not be fully accurate for your exact situation, type
of line, or application.
