Despite the common perception, you don't really need to know how to
tie many knots to contribute effectively on a boat, including the
famous bowline!

Yet, two of the most useful rope handling skills are the ones that
many experienced sailors still perform incorrectly: coiling a rope and
hitching to a cleat. You can level up your nautical expertise and be a
great asset to other sailors by learning these first. They are
guaranteed to arise on every sail, and are something the skipper is
often not able to do personally while at the helm and so appreciates
the help with.

The Techniques
=====================================================================

Below are the basic rope handling skills for boating. I prioritize
mastering them in this order, based on how helpful they are to have
crew know.

[Winch operation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaC8V8ecdpw)
: Tensioning halyards, sheets, and outhauls. This is only essential
  for keelboats, as powerboats and dinghies don't have these kinds of
  winches.

[Cleat hitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBqsF72xNSU)
: Docking, and some halyards and outhauls.

[Coiling a line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX4Zr0vdGHE&t=189s).
: Storing lines on the boat.

[Round turn and two half hitches](https://eoceanic.com/sailing/tips/16/135/a_very_useful_general_purpose_knot_the_round_turn_and_two_half_hitches/) (RT2HH)
: This is just a full wrap plus a clove hitch. Tying fenders to a
  lifeline, docking to a post or ring, fastening anything to a pole or
  bar. Preferred to a bowline when you have to tie or release under
  tension.

[Throwing a line](https://www.boatus.com/expert-advice/expert-advice-archive/2014/june/how-to-throw-a-line-properly)
: How to get a line to someone on another boat or a dock without
  it going in the water or hitting them in the face.

[Flemish coil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJsKcGFx1c8)
: Storing mooring line tails on a dock.

[Rolling hitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVOR9lOaEQg)
: Anchor snubbers and clearing a jammed winch.

[Trucker's hitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raTYwsfnsXg)
: This uses a rolling hitch and a slip knot. Attaching a small boat to
  a trailer or roof rack, tying down a boat cover.

[Bowline](https://www.animatedknots.com/bowline-knot)
: Tying sheets to a clew, tying on a dinghy painter, tying around a
  person, and go-to sailing knot--but often overused.

[Figure 8](https://www.animatedknots.com/figure-8-knot) (Flemish knot)
: Stopper knot that is easily untied, good for sheets.

[Double overhand](https://www.animatedknots.com/double-overhand-stopper-knot)
: Stopper knot that is more permanent than a figure 8. Good for
  halyards as a stopper at the bottom or ball at the top.
 
[Dinghy halyard ball attachment](halyard-ball.png)
: This method replaced the traditional
  [studding sail halyard bend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukxwS8RrJxg).
  If you have a dinghy that doesn't use a ball on the halyard, I
  recommend attaching one as this method is smaller, saving a
  centimeter or two at the masthead, and faster and easier to tie and
  untie.

Key points to know about knots:

- Knots weaken lines. The line will break at the knot, not in the
  middle of the tensioned line. Permanent attachments are
  spliced instead of tied, for strength.
- Tying more knots in a line rarely makes a better hold, and
  definitely makes it harder to untie.
- Modern synthetic lines do not hold knots as well as traditional
  lines. All of these will slip easily in something like an unsleeved
  dyneema line.


Vocabulary
=====================================================================

Some general rope vocabulary, mostly for fun because this isn't
essential in practice:

[Working end](https://www.netknots.com/rope_knots/rope-knot-terms)
: The free end of a line used to tie a knot.

[Standing part](https://www.netknots.com/rope_knots/rope-knot-terms)
: The part of the line attached to something else, so not available
  to manipulate for tying a knot.
  
[Bight](https://www.netknots.com/rope_knots/rope-knot-terms)
: Some part of the middle of a rope. This is used when referring to
  tying a knot "on a bight", meaning without a working end available.

Lazy line
: A line that is not currently in use or under tension because some
  partner rope on the other side is under tension. Frequently
  used for the sheets, the lines attached to the jib sail, and running
  backstays, which are lines that support and tension the mast.

Working line
: A line that is under tension.

[Bitter end](https://www.grammar-monster.com/sayings_proverbs/bitter_end.htm)
: The end of the anchor line that is tied to the boat.

Sleeve
: The woven covering providing UV protection and friction on a modern line.

Core
: The interior of a modern line, which provides the strength.

I cover the names of specific lines for sailing and mooring in my
other guides. They aren't "essential", either. In cases where you need
to know that, you're with someone and they will clarify, such as "the
big red rope on the left side of the boat"; you are by yourself and
don't need to know the name; or you are reading and have time to look
it up.


Next Steps
=====================================================================

This guide for rope essentials is of course only the beginning of rope
techniques employed on boats, although it covers 99% of daily
use. There's a wonderful world of knots for all kinds of line and
purposes to learn after these. I use maybe another ten knots
occasionally for specific purposes, including the
[slip knot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnkth1n_2A),
[double fisherman bend](https://www.animatedknots.com/double-fishermans-bend-knot),
[halyard hitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEEYkfINomY),
[sheet bend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MITXMnu8jo8), and
[reef (square) knot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y_iorha2k4).

However, rope maintenance skills such as splicing, eye splicing, melting,
and whipping are essential for boat maintenance and likely more
important than learning most esoteric knots, which are of more
aesthetic and historical interest than practical use.
