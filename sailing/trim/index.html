This is a practical guide for novice modern sailors. I wrote it as
a cheat sheet for novice sailors I'm teaching or who are crewing for
me an interested in learning a little more. It is not intended to be 
comprehensive and focuses mostly on modern boats.

The principles of sail selection and trim are generally the same
across all sailboats, from wind surfers up to 100' yachts. Sail trim
is an application of aerodynamics. A sail is a "wing" projecting
vertically instead of horizontally, and affects boat motion through
drag and lift forces.

I personally select and adjust sails by understanding the desired
airflow due to sail shape, and how the control lines adjust the sail
shape. This requires some up-front learning at a deeper level, but I
find it easier than memorizing a list of rules. The deep understanding
approach is also more effective and satisfing than memorization. If
you understand what is happening you are also in a better position to
trim on an unfamiliar boat or in unforseen circumstances such as with
a damaged sail or rig.


Terminology
===================================================================

There's a lot of terminology for boats. Every part generally has a
unique name. This is important for clear communication. However,
beware that the names themselves vary regionally and sometimes
between racering and cruising sailors.

*Lines* are ropes (or cables) on a boat. *Spars* are poles.


Standing Rigging
------------------------------------------------------------
A *mast* is a vertical spar and a *boom* is a horizontal spar that
holds out the corners of a sail. *Spreaders* are the horizontal bars
that push shrouds away from the mast. A *gaff* is a boom at the top of
a sail (found today most frequently on the lateen rig of Sunfish dinghies).

The *rig* is the collection of spars and lines that adjust and support
it.

Most modern sailboats are *sloops*, with a single mast and boom and
two sails. A *catboat* has only one sail and today is usually a
single-handed dinghy. 

A *ketch* has two masts (with the aft one in front of the rudder
post). These are great for shorthanded and heavy weather cruising, but
production on most stopped in the 1980s. A *yawl* has two masts, with
the aft mast behind the rudder post, and is extremely rare to
encounter today.

[Standing rigging](https://rigworks.com/standing-rigging-or-name-that-stay/)
comprises lines that are not adjusted frequently while
sailing and are generally run from the deck to the mast. The most
common ones on modern boats are:

Forestay
: At the bow, pulls the top parts of the mast forward. Some headsails
  are attached to the forestay. Not present on catboats such as Lasers. 
  A *full length* outer forestay runs to the top of the mast. A 
  *fractional rig* outer forestay runs a fraction of the way up the mast.
  On some small boats such as 420s, the forestay is only used
  for mast retention without sails and the jib halyard becomes an
  inner forestay that carries the load when raised.
  
  A *solent* rig has multiple forestays for different headsails close
  together. A *cutter* rig has *cutter stays* or *baby stays* set
  significantly further aft so that the headsails can tack without
  obstruction.

Backstay
: At the stern, tensions the top parts of the mast backward to adjust
  the bend and adds support for boats with inner forestays.  Not
  present on all boats. Boats with *running backstays* have one on
  each side of the boat and they must be adjusted for each
  tack. (Since they run, these are not "standing" rigging.)

Shrouds
: Also called "sidestays". These run from the mast to the sides of the
  boat. Shrouds are not present on some small boats such as Lasers
  that do not have a trapeze or headsails. A few unusual large boats
  have [freestanding masts](https://goodoldboat.com/freestanding-rigs/)
  without shrouds.

There are several kinds of shrouds on larger boats. These
are a combination of *continuous* shrouds that run from the
mast to the deck and *discontinous* shrouds that are shorter
pieces that terminate at spreaders.

Shrouds are named *cap* if they connect to the masthead,
*intermediate* if they connect mid-mast, and *lower* if they
connect below the spreader base.

Discontinuous shroud parts are labeled with "D#" or "V#", where
numbers increase from 1 at those that touch the deck. The "V" shrouds
are vertical and the "D" shrouds are diagonal.

[Triangular sails]

Most modern sails are triangles (versus older square-rigged ships).
Some performance sails are quadrilaterals, although are thought of 
as oversize triangles with a bit of the top cut off to get more sail area up high in
clear air. Gaff rigged sails are true quadrilaterals, but can be thought of
as triangles bent over at the top.

The corners of a triangular sail are called:

Head
: Top corner, where the halyard attaches to raise and hold it to the mast.

Clew
: Aft lower corner that moves in and out and where the sheet acts for trimming.

Tack
: Fore lower corner fixed relative to the boat about which the sail turns.


The edges of a triangular sail are called:

Luff
: Fore edge between the head and tack.

Leech
: Aft edge between the head and clew.

Foot
: Bottom edge between the clew and tack.

The *mainsail* is behind the mast, with their tack attached to the mast.

The *foresails* or *headsails* are in front of the mast. There are
several kinds of headsails:

Jib/Genoa
: The typical working headsail. Described by numbers based on the
  fraction of LP, the perpendicular forestay/luff-at-deck-to-mast edge
  that they cover. A 90 jib is 90% LP and thus clears the mast. A 110
  is 100% LP, and thus overlaps the mast slightly. Technically, a jib
  or "working jib" is at most 100 LP and a *genoa* is a sail larger
  than 100 LP. In practice, up to about 115, the term "jib" is often
  used.
  
  Genoas are also referred to by a single-digit number, which
  is generally "#1 Genoa" &approx; 150 and "#2 Genoa" &approx; 135.
  
  Jibs are referred to by single-digit numbers, but depending on the
  boat these can vary from "#1 Jib" being the largest to it being the
  smallest.

Asymmetric Spinnaker
: A large, curvy lightweight sail for downwind sailing that is attached
  at the tack to the boat, like a gigantic genoa. Often very colorful.
  These are less efficient than symmetric spinnakers for running, so
  typically used on a deep reach.

(Symmetric) Spinnaker
: A large, curvy lightweight and often colorful sail for downwind
  sailing that is attached to a spinnaker pole. The spinnaker pole is
  a boom that must be manually switched between gybes. This cases the
  spinnaker to alternate which corner is the tack and which is the
  clew depending on the gybe. These are more difficult to manage
  than asymmetric spinnakers, but more efficient dead
  downwind.

Code Zero, Drifter, Reacher, Gennaker
: Various names for lightweight, oversize genoas that are flatter than
  asymmetric spinnakers. These are good for close to deep reaches.

Running Rigging
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sheet
: Runs from the clew . Headsails often have two sheets. The 
  *working sheet* the *lazy sheet*

Halyard
:

Outhaul
:

Cunningham
: This also often called "the" *downhaul*, however technically
  any line that pulls down (the opposite of a halyard) is a downhaul.

Kicker/Vang
: Gnav

Running backstay
:
