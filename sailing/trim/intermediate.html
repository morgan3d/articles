                      **Intermediate Sail Trimming**
                         Updated 2022-12-31

![](forces.svg)

This is a practical guide for trimming sails based on physics. I wrote
it as a cheat sheet for my own crew who want to learn a little
more. This guide focuses on modern sailboats, from dinghies through
50' yachts, and emphasises upwind main and headsail trim.

This information is most useful for intermediate sailors who have
already mastered sheet trim and basic sailing jargon. It is good for
understanding topics like what the vang is for and how to control
excess heel and helm. If you are just starting to sail, look at my
[10 Easy Steps](../learn/index.html) guide for beginners instead. If
you have been sailing for a few months and are only looking for a few
tips on jib and main sheet trim, see my [novice trim](novice.html)
guide.

The principles of sail selection and trim are generally the same
across all sailboats, from wind surfers up to megayachts. Sailing is
an application of fluid dynamics. A sail, keel, and hull are airfoil
"wings" projecting vertically instead of horizontally. They create
boat motion through drag and lift forces from air and water.

I personally adjust sails by seeking to understand the desired airflow
due to sail shape, and how the control lines adjust that shape. This
requires some up-front learning and physics, but I find it easier than
memorizing a list of rules for what to do in each situation. The deep
understanding approach is also more effective and satisfing than
memorization. If you understand what is happening you are also in a
better position to trim on an unfamiliar boat or in unforseen
circumstances, such as with a damaged sail or rig.

I need jargon to explain the mechanics of sail trim clearly. To avoid
delaying that explanation with a lot of definitions, I define most key
terms as they are used and then provide a more detailed Glossary
section at the end for reference.

(#) Caveats

My experience and research is on racing dinghies and performance
cruising monohulls for coastal cruising and day sailing. Racing
yachts, multihulls, and foiling boats are designed differently than
these. Blue water sailing requires a different set of techniques for
very large waves and high winds in unavoidable storms. Additional key
considerations for those kinds of boats and sailing are not present in
my descriptions, and the best practices are often very different.

Sailing practice is always under debate. The science of understanding
sailing is constantly evolving. My own knowledge is also always under
revision, and I make mistakes. Sailing is a potentially dangerous
activity. So, while I'm providing information on sailing as I
understand it, I don't claim that it is necessarily all _correct_ or
applicable to you. Cross-check with other sources, verify through your
own experience, and as with any sailor, you must take sole
responsibility for yourself, your boat, and your crew. I intend this
document to be used to help you think about your recreational sailing
within significant safety margins. Please let me know if you encounter
an error in my documents and send me a credible source for reference.

How a Sailboat Moves
===================================================================

A Simple Model
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider a catboat, which has only one sail:

*                   |
*                   v

*         /         |             
*Boom--> '----------+ 
*      .------------+-----.
*     /|       HULL      /     
*    |  '+-----+----+---'      
*    |__/      |   /
*              |__/
* RUDDER
*              KEEL
****************************

The sail is an airfoil. It is curved like an airplane wing.  Wind
flowing over the sail creates *lift* approximately perpendicular to
the face of the sail, which is horizontal over the water instead of
vertical as in an airplane.

The simplest useful mental model of a sailboat is that there is a lift
force a little closer to forward than perpendicular from the boom, and
the keel cancels out most of the horizontal portion of this. 

Your goals are to maximize the sail's lift force and minimize drag in
the air and water.

To maximize the lift force, first adjust the mainsheet (rope connected
to the boom) so that the boom, and thus the leading edge of the sail,
are pointing approximately into the wind. You know that it is
correctly oriented when the sail is not luffing (flapping) and most of
the telltales (ribbons on the sail) are flying backwards on _both_
sides of the sail. Don't underestimate the challenge of this first
adjustment.  At many Wednesday night sailboat races you could place
well by being the person who doesn't overtrim the sail, even without
knowing any of the other sail controls.

Second, adjust control lines so that all of the telltales are flying,
the ones on the trailing edge of the sail are sometimes breaking
(fluttering), the curve of the sail is deepest a bit in front of the center,
the boat is not heeling too much, and the rudder is not
pressed too hard. The rest of this guide explains how to approach that
more refined level of sail adjustment and how to deal with other
considerations that affect boat speed and safety.

A further detail needed to complete the simple model is that when
running (sailing with the wind behind the boat), the sail produces no
lift. Instead, it is a like parachute being moved forward by drag. In that
case, your goals are to minimize drag in the water and _maximize_ drag
in the air.

Adjusting the sail when running before the wind is a separate set of
skills, which are trickier to master and also involve more safety
concerns.  However, somewhat surprisingly, the fastest way to sail
downwind is often to avoid running entirely and instead push the edge
of the lift mode by sailing at more of an angle.


The Role of the Keel
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The next level of sophistication in a model of how a sailboat moves is
added by considering how keel counteracts the sideways force from the
sail's lift.  See Bryon Anderson's
[The Physics of Sailing](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2883908)
from Physics Today, 2008 for a careful explanation with force diagrams
and equations, or read my higher-level summary below.

The hull shape and the fins of the keel and rudder produce significant
drag resistance against the water to lateral movement, so the boat
primarily moves forward. Because the sail experiences lift mostly
sideways and there is sideways drag, the boat *heels* (tilts) over.

The keel and rudder experience motion through the water with unequal
pressure due to the sideways motion, so they also produce lift. Their
lift is in the opposite direction but under the waterline. It thus
further heels the boat but helps to counteract the sideways aspect of
the sail's lift. Because water is more than 1000 times more dense
than air, even slow movement of a relatively small keel through water
can produce substantial lift equivalent to a large sail through
fast moving air.

![Force diagram by [Anderson](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/na101/home/literatum/publisher/aip/journals/content/pto/2008/pto.2008.61.issue-2/1.2883908/production/images/large/1.2883908.figures.f1.jpeg)](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/na101/home/literatum/publisher/aip/journals/content/pto/2008/pto.2008.61.issue-2/1.2883908/production/images/large/1.2883908.figures.f1.jpeg) 

In a large boat, the keel and mass inside of the boat form *ballast*
(righting weight) that helps the boat to stay upright with these twin
lift forces creating heel. In a small boat, the crew shift their own
weight as ballast.

Turning the rudder directs its lift, and more significantly creates
asymmetric drag that rotates the boat about its keel.

When *close hauled* (sailing above 45 degrees to the wind), the
sail's lift is nearly perpendicular to the direction of travel of the
boat. So, the boat moves slowly and heels significantly. It often _feels_
fast because several slow-but-exciting phenomena occur:

- The sheets (ropes controlling the sails) are under high tension.
- The boat is heeling far over, so the water is visibly and audibly rushing past
- The apparent wind (relative speed of the wind because the boat is itself moving) is maximized because
  the boat is facing more into the wind.
- The tiller (stick attached to the rudder)/helm (steering wheel) is pulling
  hard because the pressure on the sail so far behind the mast and the shape
  of the heeled-over hull are forcing the boat to try to turn into the wind.

When on a *beam reach* (sailing at 90 degrees to the wind, also called "off the wind"),
the boom is closer to perpendicular to the centerline of the boat.
The sail's lift is directed mostly forward in this situation. That is why
point of sail is very fast, even though it may feel slower than close hauled.
There is little heeling. The rudder is not pulling hard because the boat
is flat and the force on the sail is now closer to the center of mass of the 
boat, so it is not pushing on the back of the boat. Without sideways force
on the keel and rudder, the pressure is approximately equal on the sides
and they produce no sideways lift.

On a dinghy, one can even raise the daggerboard/centerboard (a
lightweight, removable keel) when reaching because its sideways lift is
not needed and the small amount of drag on forward motion from its leading
edge is undesirable.

Because the boat is accelerated by lift on the sails and keel, with
sufficiently large sails and a lightweight boat it is possible to sail
upwind faster than the wind speed. In fact, were the boat not accelerated
primarily by lift, boats could not reach or sail upwind at all, as they
are also creating drag with the wind trying to push the entire boat in 
the opposite of the direction of travel.


Sailing Downwind
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When *running* (sailing about 150 degrees from the wind or further,
with the wind coming from behind the boat), the sails obviously cannot produce lift because
wind is no longer running over them. Instead, they operate in a different mode,
which is significantly less efficient. For running before the wind, 
the sails act like giant parachutes and create drag force against the moving
wind. This is very slow, and even with large spinnaker sails, running is
often the slowest point of sail. Most boats can only achieve a fraction of
the wind speed when running, and no normal sailboat can exceed it.

It is often faster to sail deep broad reaches (about 140 degrees off
the wind) and gybe (have the wind cross the back of the boat when turning)
back and forth than to run straight downwind.

The sail angles I gave above were approximate. That is because actual
points of sail depend on the boat, and are defined _by_ the balance of
forces. For example, the definition of running before the wind is when
the boat is using the sail for drag instead of lift!

Amount of Sail
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Your most significant sail adjustment is one that is changed
infrequently and often overlooked: how much sail to fly. Too little
sail leaves you underpowered, slow, and with limited
maneuverability. Too much sail (or the wrong kind) leaves you
overpowered, which is slower and harder to maneuver than the right
amount of power, and increases risk for both the boat and the crew.

For dinghy racing I carry as much sail as I think I can manage, and
err on the side of slightly too much. I can depower the sail if
needed, and the worst case in a dinghy is still not too bad--usually
more swimming and losing the race, sometimes breaking parts of the
boat and a few hundred dollars in repairs. Also, if underpowered there
is nothing I can do to speed up, but if overpowered I can somewhat
balance it by by brute force (at the cost of exhaustion).

For cruising and day sailing I am instead conservative. If I don't
have furling sails, I round down on the sail sizes I rig at the start
of the day. I reef slightly _before_ I think I need to when on the
water, as soon as there is any question of becoming overpowered
later. I'm not in a hurry to get somewhere at the scale where another
knot of boat speed will make a huge difference. On a large boat the
risks are larger and there is no way to use human-scale brute force to
handle being overpowered.

Note that I never seriously race large boats as the skipper, so I have
no advice for that third case, where being over-conservative in a
large boat has a cost.


### Dinghies

Dinghies often have multiple sails, and sometimes multiple masts, as a
way to adjust sail area.  For example, the RS Aero has three different
rig sizes and a
[guide](https://www.rsaerosailing.org/docs/936851985.pdf) for which
one to use based on the wind strength and the sailor's weight and
experience. For these boats, you choose your sail before you set out,
and must return to land to change it if the conditions shift.

### Headsails

Larger boats typically have multiple headsails with different areas,
which can be changed while underway. Some have multiple roller-furling
headsails, which can be flown or furled away without going to the
foredeck. To furl a headsail, ease the sheet until the sail is gently
luffing and then pull the furling line while easing the sheet until
the sail is completely furled with the UV protection strip visible and
the sheets are wrapped around it a few times. Then cleat the furling
line. It is easiest and best for the sail to do this on a broad reach
so that the headsail is blanketed, or above close hauled so that there
is little force on it. Finally, unfurl the new sail.

If the new sail is on an inner forestay, instead unfurl the new sail
_first_, so that it blankets the outer sail and depowers it, and then
furl the outer sail.

Roller furling headsails can only be dropped by the halyard when fully
unfurled. If your furler jams while reefing, then you must try to
unjam it (often the line itself is jammed up). If you are unable to
free it and it is safe to go forward, then you can free the sheets
from the cockpit and manually wrap or lash the sail to the forestay
until the wind is light enough to fully unwrap and drop the sail.

To change a *hanked-on* (clipped) headsail underway, carefully move to
the foredeck. Ease the halyard and pull the sail in and to the deck
without releasing the sheet tension. Lash the sail down, or stow it in
a sailbag and release the clips. Then raise the new sail, reversing
this process. It is often easiest to take down a headsail on a broad
reach, with no risk of a gybe but the headsail blanketed by the
mainsail to depower it.

#### Furler-Reefing a Headsail

With an appropriately made headsail, you can also partly furl
it. Beware that most of the tension on a headsail is at the head and
the tack. When you partly furl the sail, a new head and tack are
introduced that may not be at locations that are reinforced on the
sail, and will quickly distort or destroy it.

The intended reefing points are usually clearly marked on the sail
with sewed-in vertical stripes at the foot, or drawn on lines. It is a
good idea to mark the same points on your furling line at the cleat.

Beware that even when furled to the appropriate reef point, a furled
headsail has a suboptimal shape compared to a smaller sail fully
flown.  Sails are is cut to be the right shape when fully flown, not
when furled.  A partly furled headsail also has poor flow over the
luff (leading edge) of the sail because there is a large roll there
instead of a clean edge. For these reasons, racers avoid partly furling
headsails. They either use multiple furling headsails on separate stays
or hanked-on jibs.

When pulling on a furling line, watch the sail and avoid using a
winch. If the furler jams you want to notice immediately. If it is on
winch you will have enough mechanical advantage to force it and break
something--probably your sail and furler, and possibly the forestay,
which could then bring the mast down.

### Adjusting Jib Cars

When reducing sail, remember to move jib cars forward (or upward if
using 3D fairleads) if you have them. This accounts for the jib clew
now being higher and further forward. 

However, if you expect to be overpowered even with your smallest or
most-reefed headsail, then leaving the car in place when the clew
moves forward. In that case the further aft car position will flatten
the bottom of the headsail (reducing lift) and luff the top of the
headsail (spilling air and reducing heeling), giving you more control
over the boat.

In the ideal situation, you have an appropriately sized and well
trimmed sail, instead of intentionally making it inefficient because
it is too large.

### Reefing the Main

When adjusting sail area while underway, I reduce the mainsail before
the jib, and increase the jib before the main. I do this for two
reasons. The main produces the most heeling force, so yields the largest
change when adjusted. In strong winds you also do not want too little
headsail because or gusts will point the boat up into the wind.

Most boats have only one mainsail. To reduce adjust its area, you reef
it. Depending on the boat and the conditions, the first reef is
usually put in between 15 and 20 kts of wind speed and the second reef
around 25 kts. If a third reef is available, it usually put in around
30-35 kts. The wind speeds listed are a very coarse guide.

I reef based on current and anticipate boat heel/helm, wind
variability of direction and strength, and sea state, not raw wind
speed. I also reef early when I expect it to be harder to do so later
due to a short leg between tacks or gybes or marine traffic, and
prefer to reef while sailing upwind on starboard if at all possible, as it is
easier to depower the sails and I have navigation rights over other
boats. Note that
[cold air is denser](https://www.sirius-yachts.com/best-headsail-arrangement/),
so expect to be reefing in lighter wind in those conditions.


#### Slab Reefing Traditional Main

In a traditional/slab reefing system is reefed by first easing the
*halyard* (line that pulls the head up) to partly lower the sail. You
then tension a new *outhaul* (line that pulls the clew back) and run
the cunningham (line that pulls down on the tack) through a new
grommet (reinforced hole). These clew and tack points further up on
the sail than the base ones, so this process shortens the sail.

If there is no cunningham, there will be a *ram's horn* (twisted metal
hook) at the front of the boom to attach the new tack to. Then you
re-tension the halyard. Before beginning this operation, ensure that
the *topping lift* (line from the top of the mast to the back of the
boom) is attached if you have one, so that the boom does not crash
into the cockpit when the halyard is eased.

When the main is reefed, extra sail will hang down. Lightly lash this
to the boom or collect it in the long "stack pack" sail bag attached
to the boom if there is one. Some sails have grommets along the new
foot of the reefed sail. Those are for lightly lashing the folds
together. They are not reinforced and are not for holding the foot of
the sail to the boom.

#### Furling Main

On a roller-furling main, simply adjust the boom to be perpendicular
to the mast, depower the main by adjusting the sheet, and then furl to
the desired reduced area. Be careful to keep the sail from completely 
luffing and maintain tension on the outhaul (for mast furling) or halyard
(for boom furling) so that the furler does not jam.

A furling main has three advantages over a traditional main. It is
easier to take in and shake out (remove) a reef, so you are more
likely to do so and optimize your sail plan. You can reef to arbitrary
points instead of the pre-chosen reefs, so it is more flexible. It is
safer because, if control lines are led to the cockpit, there is no
need to leave the cockpit and go to the mast for the tack or lashing
the folds of the sail.

There are also downsides of roller-furling mainsails (besides
cost). For a boom furling main, you lose the ability to trim the foot
of the sail using the outhaul. That's a significant tuning factor. If
you aren't careful with the exact angle of the boom, the furler may
jam. A jam while raising the sail is largely irritating, but not
dangerous if your engine is available as a propulsion mechanism.  A
jam while lowering the sail is not a problem because the sail can be
dropped onto the deck.

The more popular in-mast furling retains control of the foot of the
sail, although loses most control over luff tension instead. But it
has the more serious drawback that if the furler jams, you may be
unable to drop the mainsail in an emergency. That is in contrast to a
furling headsail. For a headsail, the furling mechanism is externally
waccessible for repair and also the sail can be manually passed around
the forestay or lashed with a spare halyard in an emergency, albeit
somewhat awkwardly and dangerously.

For in-mast furling, the sail furls at the leading edge (luff), it
cannot have horizontal battens (stiffening rods) to help it maintain
shape. Some mainsails have vertical battens to compensate. Finally, in
storm conditions an in-mast furled main keeps all of the mass of the
furled part of the (probably wet) mainsail high up on the mast, which
makes the boat heel and roll more.


Glossary
===================================================================

There's a lot of terminology for boats. Every part generally has a
unique name. This is important for clear communication. However,
beware that the names themselves vary regionally and sometimes
between racing and cruising sailors within a region.

Spars
------------------------------------------------------------

*Spars* are poles. A *mast* is a vertical spar and a *boom* is a
horizontal spar that holds out the foot of a sail. The universal joint
where the main boom is attached to the mast is called a *gooseneck*.
*Spreaders* are the horizontal bars that push shrouds away from the
mast.

The *rig* is the collection of spars and lines that adjust and support
it. The *rigging* is the lines.

Most modern sailboats are Bermuda rig *sloops*, with a single mast and
boom and two sails. A *catboat* has only one sail and today is usually
a single-handed dinghy, although a handful of catboat yachts are in
production.

A *ketch* has two masts (with the aft one in front of the rudder
post). These are great for shorthanded and heavy weather cruising
because of the low center of effort and flexibility of sail plan, but
fell out of favor in the 1980s as cruisers adopted a more racing
aesthetic and favored the reduced cost of a single mast. 

A *yawl* has two masts, with the aft mast behind the rudder post, and
is extremely rare to encounter today.

Sunfish are one of the few common modern dinghies with an unusual rig.
Their *lateen rig* has a lower boom that crosses past the mast instead
of ending at it, and a second,
[upper boom](https://laserperformance.com/wp-content/uploads/SunfishRiggingGuide_2022.pdf)
at the top that pulls the top of the sail up.


Foils
------------------------------------------------------------

Keels and rudders are *foils*. They are in fact waterfoils 
(analogous to airfoils), and serve to create lift and drag
forces for controling direction. Rudders provide direct
control over the direction of the boat. Keels are necessary for
monohulls to travel upwind. Multihull boats can move
upwind without them due to the force from their hulls, but
benefit for upwind performance. 

A *daggerboard* is a keel whose underwater area can be adjusted by
moving it vertically through the hull to reduce its force when
sailing, reduce draft when launching and retreiving, and for
storage. Daggerboards are primarily found on dinghies, but are also
used on some catamarans.

A *centerboard* is a keel whose are can be adjusted by pivoting around
the attachment to the hull. These have the advantage that they will
kick up when accidentally running aground, reducing damage
compared to a daggerboard.

In general sailing jargon, a "keel" usually refers to the keel
of a larger boat, which has significant ballast (weight) added
to increase the righting moment of the boat. 

A *fixed keel* is a keel that cannot be adjusted. A *bolt on* keel
has been attached to the hull by bolts that must periodically [be
inspected](https://www.practical-sailor.com/blog/keel-bolt-inspection-and-repair) for 
structural stability. This is the most common kind in modern
boats. An *encapsulated keel* is molded into the hull and 
stronger in the face of grounding or striking submerged objects
at sea, and generally less vulnerable.

A *swing keel* has such balast and it swings up like 
a centerboard for reducing draft. The ballast is less effective when
raised.

A *centerboard keel* is more like a dinghy centerboard. It keeps the
ballast fixed in the hull or near the center of rotation and leading
edge so that it still has righting moment when the keel is raised.

A *lifting keel* is a weighted keel that moves like a daggerboard and
raises vertically. 

In addition to allowing a boat to moor very close to shore,
some lifting, swing, and centerboard keels allow a boat to *dry out*
with the tide and sit flat on the bottom without external support.

A *full keel* runs a significant fraction of the length of the boat.
It provides good protection for itself and for the rudder and
propeller and may have shallow draft, and helps provide a wide slick
when heaving to. Full keels give a more comfortable boat motion that
reduces rocking and pitching. Full keels have lower performance head
upwind and may turn more slowly, and are primarily found on
older cruising boats.

A *cutaway forefoot* on a full keel means that the front begins
midway through the hull instead of at the bow to increase maneuverability and some upwind performance.

A *fin keel* projects downward near the center of the boat like a fin.
These are the standard on modern racing boats and dinghies. They are 
also easier to maneuver backwards under power when docking. 

A *long chord* fin keel is relatively long fore to aft, to increase
stability at the expense of performance.

A *canting keel* can have its angle adjusted side to side. These are
found on some high performance racing yachts.

*Bulb* and *wing* keels shorten their draft by placing a large weight
at the base. Because they lack length, they provide righting moment
from the ballast but have reduced lift and drag and are less efficient
than other types.

*Twin keels*, also called *dual keels* and *bilge keels* are a pair of
side by side keels, tilted slightly outwards to their respective
sides. They reduce draft without sacrificing area for lift and drag
force. They also allow a boat to *dry out* with the tide or be placed
*on the hard* (on shore by a crain) and sit without external supports.
Unlike swing and other adjustible keels, they also provide access to the boat bottom for maintenance in this position
because the hull is not flush with the ground.
However, cleaning and painting between the keels is more difficult
than for fin and full keels because of the reduced space.

Some obscure boats have *leeboards*, which are matching boards or
swing keels on the outer sides of the boat instead of in the
center. These appear on some historical boats, especially from 
China and Holland, and on sailing canoes.

Standing Rigging
------------------------------------------------------------

*Lines* are ropes (or cables) on a boat. *Rigging* is the set of lines
associated with the sails and spars.

[Standing rigging](https://rigworks.com/standing-rigging-or-name-that-stay/)
comprises lines that are not adjusted frequently while
sailing and are generally run from the deck to the mast. The most
common ones on modern boats are:

Forestay
: At the bow, pulls the top parts of the mast forward. Some headsails
  are attached to the forestay. Not present on catboats such as Lasers. 
  A *full length* outer forestay runs to the top of the mast. A 
  *fractional rig* outer forestay runs a fraction of the way up the mast.
  On some small boats such as 420s, the forestay is only used
  for mast retention without sails and the jib halyard becomes an
  inner forestay that carries the load when raised.
  
  A *solent* rig has multiple forestays for different headsails close
  together. A *cutter* rig has *cutter stays* or *baby stays* set
  significantly further aft so that the headsails can tack without
  obstruction.

Backstay
: At the stern, tensions the top parts of the mast backward to adjust
  the bend and adds support for boats with inner forestays.  Not
  present on all boats. Boats with *running backstays* have one on
  each side of the boat and they must be adjusted for each
  tack. (Since they run, these are not "standing" rigging.)

Shrouds
: Also called "sidestays". These run from the mast to the sides of the
  boat. Shrouds are not present on some small boats such as Lasers
  that do not have a trapeze or headsails. A few unusual large boats
  have [freestanding masts](https://goodoldboat.com/freestanding-rigs/)
  without shrouds.

There are several kinds of shrouds on larger boats. These
are a combination of *continuous* shrouds that run from the
mast to the deck and *discontinous* shrouds that are shorter
pieces that terminate at spreaders.

Shrouds are named *cap* if they connect to the masthead,
*intermediate* if they connect mid-mast, and *lower* if they
connect below the spreader base.

Discontinuous shroud parts are labeled with "D#" or "V#", where
numbers increase from 1 at those that touch the deck. The "V" shrouds
are vertical and the "D" shrouds are diagonal.

[Names for the corners and edges of the sail]

Most modern sails are triangles.  Some performance mainsails
technically have four sides, although are thought of as oversize
triangles with a bit of the top cut off to get more sail area up high
in clear air. Some gaff rigged sails are true quadrilaterals, but can also 
be thought of as triangles that are bent over at the top.

The corners of a triangular sail are called:

Head
: Top corner, where the halyard attaches to raise and hold it to the mast.

Clew
: Aft lower corner that moves in and out and where the sheet acts for trimming.

Tack
: Fore lower corner fixed relative to the boat about which the sail turns.


The edges of a triangular sail are called:

Luff
: Fore edge between the head and tack.

Leech
: Aft edge between the head and clew.

Foot
: Bottom edge between the clew and tack.

The *roach* is the part of the sail between the leech and the direct
head-to-clew line. The term is used almost exclusively with mainsails.

A *mainsail* is behind a mast, with the tack attached to the mast.
The foot of the mainsail is attached to the boom. In [extreme storm
conditions](https://www.yachtingworld.com/video/skip-novak-storm-sailing-part-3-using-storm-sails-517) on the ocean, a mainsail may be replaced with a tiny *trysail*
that has a free foot. Sloops have a single mainsail.

A mainsail may have either vertical or horizontal *battens*, which
are thin beams of fiberglass that help it maintain a curved shape.

The *foresails* or *headsails* are in front of the mast. In the
simplest case, you're daysailing and the headsail is just going
to be referred to as the *jib*.

If you're racing or cruising, the kinds of headsails you might
encounter are:

Jib/Genoa
: The typical working headsail. Described by numbers based on the
  fraction of J, the perpendicular forestay/luff-at-deck-to-mast edge
  that they cover. A 90 jib is 90% J and thus clears the mast. A 110
  is 100% J, and thus overlaps the mast slightly. Technically, a jib
  or "working jib" is at most 100 J and a *genoa* is a sail larger
  than 100 J. In practice, up to about 115, the term "jib" is often
  used.
  
  Genoas are also referred to by a single-digit number, which
  is generally "#1 Genoa" &approx; 150 and "#2 Genoa" &approx; 135.
  
  Jibs are referred to by single-digit numbers, but depending on the
  boat these can vary from "#1 Jib" being the largest to it being the
  smallest.
  
  On a solent rig, the genoa is usually furled on an outer forestay 
  and cannot be tacked without being furled. The sheets can be run
  around the outside to allow them to gybe, however, if there is not
  a Code Zero or other sail in front of them.
  
  On a cutter rig, the genoa can usually tack in front of the cutter 
  stay with some care.

Staysail/Storm Jib
: A very small jib, possibly on a baby stay or other inner stay.  This
  is for extreme conditions, primarily for keeping the bow off the
  wind when a gust causes the boat to turn up, or for tracking
  straight into the wind when motorsailing.

Asymmetric Spinnaker
: A large, curvy lightweight sail for downwind sailing that is attached
  at the tack to the boat, like a gigantic genoa. Often very colorful.
  These are less efficient than symmetric spinnakers for running, so
  typically used on a deep reach. These cannot tack without being doused.

(Symmetric) Spinnaker
: A large, curvy lightweight and often colorful sail for downwind
  sailing that is attached to a spinnaker pole. The spinnaker pole is
  a boom that must be manually switched between gybes. This cases the
  spinnaker to alternate which corner is the tack and which is the
  clew depending on the gybe. These are more difficult to manage
  than asymmetric spinnakers, but more efficient dead
  downwind. These cannot tack without being doused.

Code Zero, Drifter, Reacher, Gennaker
: Various names for lightweight, oversize genoas-like sails that are
  flatter than asymmetric spinnakers. These are good from a close to a
  deep reach. They are usually rigged on an outer forestay and cannot
  tack without being furled.

Old ships had other sails you will not typically encounter, such as
the "square" (actually rectangular) sails, topsails above the main,
the yankee jib with a very high clew, and downwind studding sails that
stick out far and low from each side.

*Furling* sails can be rolled up onto the forestay, inside of the mast,
or inside of the boom.

The spinnakers and code zero sails are often referred to a "downwind sails".
The main, jibs, and genoas are sometimes called "white sails" regardless
of their color because they are traditionally white and the downwind sails
are often colored.

Running Rigging
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sheet
: Sheets are attached to the clew, possibly indirectly via a boom.
  They pull the clew towards the centerline of the boat and also flatten
  the sail a little by pulling back or down, tensioning the leech, and
  on a headsail, the foot. 
  
  Headsails often have two sheets, one around each side of the mast so
  that they can be adjusted from the cockpit. In this case, the
  *working sheet* is the one that is currently under tension and the
  *lazy sheet* is the one that is loose on the other side.
  
  A *self-tacking* headsail has a single sheet and its clew is
  attached to a jib boom or a traveller. It automatically slides to
  the correct side.
  
  The *mainsheet* attaches to the main boom. On a small boat may be
  adjusted directly ("boom sheeting") from the boom or run to a block
  mounted in the middle of the cockpit.  On a larger boat it may be
  attached in the cockpit, run through a series of blocks on the
  coachroof, or attached behind the helm.

Traveler
: A track with a block on a car, typically for the mainsheet. This
  allows moving the attachment point for the mainsheet from the center
  of the boat towards the side the boom is on. The traveler offers two
  features: the main can quickly be eased by releasing the traveler to
  slide outward, and the main can be pulled down (to flatten it) via
  the mainsheet by positioning the car directly under the mainsheet.
  Not present on all boats.

Halyard
: A line that pulls a sail up. The halyard adjusts tension on the luff.
  There is one halyard per sail.

Outhaul
: A line that pulls the mainsail clew back (out) away from the mast.
  The outhaul adjusts tension on the foot. On a boat with a mast-furling
  main, it also is used to unroll the sail.

Cunningham
: This also often called "the" *downhaul*, however technically
  any line that pulls down (opposing a halyard) is a downhaul.
  The cunningham attaches to the the main just above the tack
  and adjusts luff tension.

(Boom) Vang
: The vang runs between the foot of the mast and the boom. It adjusts
  leech tension on the mainsail by angling the boom down, and prevents
  the boom from riding up in gusts. This is called the "kicking strap"
  or "kicker" in the UK, especially by racers. The vang may be
  hydraulic in larger boats instead of a line and support the boom as
  well as pull it down.
  
  An inverted vang that uses a gas strut above the boom performs the
  same role while leaving more room for crew to pass under the boom in
  a small boat. This is sometimes called a "gnav"--vang spelled
  backwards.
  
  Some small boats lack a vang and must rely on the mainsheet for
  luff tension.

Running backstays
: These connect from the middle of the mast to the back corners of the
  boat.  Only one is *working* at a time, and the other is
  *lazy*. Running backstays must be swapped for each tack, and very
  carefully in a gybe to avoid the boom colliding with one under tension.
  Few recent boats have running backstays because of their complexity.



Mechanical Advantage
------------------------------------------------------------

A *winch* is a drum that a line is wrapped around to make it easier to
tension. *Dress* a winch by running the line _clockwise_ around it at
least three times. Sometimes four wraps are needed for very high
tension lines. Be careful not to let the line overwrap itself or to
get fingers caught inside. Winches accept a handle at the end of the
drum, which is a lever that provides mechanical advantage.  Some are
also electrically powered and can be turned by pressing a button.

Some winches provide further mechanical advantage by having the drum
rotates more slowly than the handle is turned, so that less force is
required but for more time when tensioning. Rachet winches tension
clockwise and have no effect counterclockwise. Dual-speed winches give
higher mechanical advantage counterclockwise. To ease a line that is
on a winch, put your hand over the wraps around the drum and slowly
let it out.  To completely release a line that is not under tension,
swirl the line counterclockwise around the drum.

Many modern winches are *self-tailing* and incorporate a round clam
cleat at the top of the winch. For traditional winches, you must
maintain tension on the line by hand while rotating the drum.

Very large professional racing boats have [pedestal winches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irpD7eABfbc)
where the drum is separated from the handles by a gear and chain
system and the handles look like an upside-down bicycle pedal
mechanism. These typically have dedicated crew positions called grinders.

A *block* is a pulley or set of pulleys. The part that turns is called
a *sheave*. Blocks change the direction of a line. When a line passes
through the same block multiple times, it gives mechanical advantage
by allowing the block to be pulled on using less force but requiring
more line to be pulled through it.

A *cleat* holds a line under tension so that it does not have to 
be held. Some small boats have only one or two cleats, such as for
the halyard. Large boats are covered in cleats for their many
high tension control lines.

The kinds of cleats commonly encountered in small and midsize boats are:

Cam Cleat
: Has two cam (teardrop) shaped, toothed jaws that swivel. Cleat the
  line by pulling it between the cams while tightening. Release by tensioning
  the line and pulling away from the cams. With practice, it can be released
  by sending a fast wave of slack down the line.
  
Clam Cleat
: A valley of fixed teeth that the line is pulled through. Cleat and
  release in the same way as with a cam cleat.
  
Horn Cleat
: These are used for lines that are seldom adjusted, such as mooring
  (docking) or halyards. Has a tapered bar forming two horns, attached
  by two legs to a surface. Cleat by tying a
  [cleat hitch or OXO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LepMcTJuFfI),
  uncleat by untying the hitch. With some practice, the cleat hitch
  can be tied at a distance for docking by flipping loops down the
  line.
  
  Many people tie cleat hitches insecurely, especially in North
  America.  See
  [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBqsF72xNSU) for
  details on the number of wraps based on thickness and the locking
  loop direction.

Jam Cleat
: A wedge with a rounded end, which looks like half of a horn cleat
  very close to a surface.  Cleat by wrapping the line around the
  smooth part and jamming it under the horn. Release by pulling out 
  of the horn. Not as common as the other cleats.

V-Jam Cleat
: An arch with a V shaped cutout that a line can be jammed
  into. Cleat by pulling into the V, release by pulling out.

Clutch
: Technically not a "cleat", but it performs the same function. The
  line runs through a hole and then a lever can be pressed down to
  lock jaws against the line. cleat by pressing down with the lever.
  Release by first tensioning the line and then pulling up the lever
  and flipping it fully open.
  
  Used extensively on larger modern boats to lead multiple lines to a
  single winch. Although you _can_ physically tighten a line when it
  is in a clutch, do not do so as it separates the sleeve from the
  core and puts wear on the sleeve. Likewise, do not release when the 
  line is not under tension or it will create the same kind of wear.
  
Bollard/Bitts
: Single (bollard) or paired vertical posts used for mooring lines on
  large ships, sometimes with crossbars. These never appear on small
  boats, and are only used with small boats when temporarily mooring
  to a ship or large-ship dock.
