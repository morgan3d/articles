                       **Novice Sail Trimming**
                         Updated 2022-12-27

This guide is for novice sailors. Ideally, you're comfortable sailing
a dinghy or small keelboat on your own as described in the
[10 Easy Steps](../learn/index.html) guide and are familiar with the
[Essential Rope Techniques](../rope/index.html). Now, you want to
improve your sail handling beyond intuition.

This guide is also good if you're crewing on a larger boat and want to
move beyond following the skipper's instructions to having some
autonomy in sail adjustment.

If already you've mastered the techniques in this article, then my
[intermediate trimming](intermediate.html) guide may be more appropriate.

There's a lot more to effective sailing than sail handling. Steering,
navigation, ballast management, mooring, rig adjustment, race
strategy, and boat maintenance are all key skills. However, if you're
day sailing in a small boat, or crewing for someone else, then sail
handling is one of the first skills you'll want independent ability
in.

The short version of this article is simple. The sail is a
vertical airfoil when the wind is coming from in front or beside the
boat.  Adjust the sail's angle of attack optimally by easing the sheet
(rope) attached to the sail until the boom is pointed approximately
into the wind and the sail is just about to start luffing (flapping).
When the wind is coming from behind the boat, the sail is a parachute
and you should ease the sheet to catch as much wind as possible.

The rest of this article explains relevant terminology for
communicating with others on the boat and the details to let
you better understand and predict what is happening.

Wind
====================================================================

Wind is described by the direction it comes _from_. An East wind blows
from East to West. If it is due East, then facing 90 degrees on a
compass is facing into the wind.

Wind speed is measured in knots, abbreviated kt or kts. 1 knot is one nautical mile per
hour, where a nautical mile is one degree of lattitude or about
1/24000 the circumference of the Earth.

10 kts is about 11.5 mph and 18.5 kph; as a rule of thumb, slightly
higher when covereted to mph and a little less than double in kph. 
This is important because your forecast may be in different units.

The power of wind rises with the cube of wind speed. So, the
difference between 5 and 10 kts is about the same as the difference
between 20 and 21 kts. This means that the exact wind speed is 
more important to attend to in strong conditions.

Cold air is also denser and thus more powerful at the same speed than
warm air. 

Larger and heavier boats need more wind to accelerate them. Because of
the temperature and relative speed issues, a "5 kt difference" in wind
speed doesn't tell you enough information to judge the impact.

It can be hard to sail with less than 5 kts of wind because it is too
light to move even small boats well. 5-10 kts is good beginner wind,
10-15 is also fine for beginners but is where things become
interesting for more experienced sailors. 15-20 kts is too much for a
beginner in most boats. Above 20 kts is advanced sailing in a small
boat and the higher end of intermediate in a large boat. Above 30 kts
is challenging to handle in sailboats of all sizes and expert
territory.

Wind is not constant. It changes direction and strength
continuously throughout the day in predictable ways, and *shifts*
on a scale of every few minutes in many areas. If there are large
landforms--or other boats--nearby, they will also block or redirect
wind.

You should always look at a forecast before sailing to know the
approximate conditions and general way that they will change.  Then,
while sailing pay attention to wind strength and direction.  You can
tell which way the wind is blowing by looking at flags, loose hair,
windvanes, and trees. If you are ever very confused, simply ease your
mainsail and the boom will point into the wind. Many boats have a wind
indicator (windvane) on the top of the mast, or pieces of yarn tied to
the stays to help visualize the wind direction.

Look for signs of small changes in the wind strength and
direction. You can see these by watching the movement of dark patches
on the surface of the water, as well as by watching other
sailboats. The patches are easier to notice when wearing polarized
sunglasses that cut the glare. If there is a large glassy patch of
water, that is smooth and has little wind. If sailing near buildings
or cliffs, beware of ways that wind may bend significantly near them.

A *gust* of wind is a sudden, short-lived increase in wind strength.
It often comes from a different direction than the average wind.
A *puff* is a small gust, shorter and weaker. A *lull* is a time
where the wind is reduced. A *hole* is the area where the lull
is occuring. To sail fast, link together puffs and avoid holes,
focusing on where you can sail effectively near your desired
direction rather than sticking to a specific 
straight line course.

On a day with scattered clouds, the shadows of clouds traveling across
the water correspond to areas of slightly different temperature and
often can be used to predict puffs and lulls.

Always check towards the horizon in the direction of the average wind.
That's where new weather will come from, including rainstorms that
you should keep an eye out for. When a rainstorm arrives,
it will usually be extremely windy right before it hits, and then
the wind will die within the rain and remain light afterwards.

In shore areas on the ocean the wind will reverse direction during
the day between sea breeze and land breeze.


Beaufort Scale
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The
[Beaufort scale](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/beaufort.html)
maps windspeeds to the sea conditions they create on the ocean and
gives them names and Force numbers. Everything up to 27 kts is a
variation on "*breeze*" that is reasonable for expert sailors to
navigate without special preparation.

More than 28 kts begins *gale* conditions that nobody seeks out
(except for advanced windsurfers) in a sailboat, but which advanced
sailors may have to handle if they encounter them while on an 
ocean passage or during a race.

A *storm* in nautical terminology does not mean rain and thunder as it
does in colloquiual terminology. A nautical storm may include those
but is defined by high wind, above 48 kts. Think of this as when a
forecaster refers to a "tropical storm". Above 64 kts these storms are
also classified as *hurricanes* in the Atlantic, which regionally are
known as cyclones or typhoons elsewhere.

For the kinds of boats and sailors where the upper ends of the
Beaufort scale are relevant, it is not actually the wind that is the
issue. While it is indeed difficult and potentially dangerous to
manage a sailboat in high wind, waves are the more significant issue.

Wind creates waves as it passes over large stretchs of open water.



How a Sail Works
====================================================================


Points of Sail
====================================================================

![The points of sail on starboard tack](points-of-sail.svg)

A sailboat cannot sail closer than ("above") about 30 degrees to the
wind.  When within about 30 degrees, the sail will not hold its shape
because there is insufficient wind pressure difference on the sides,
and it flaps back and forth ("luffs"). Because it has no shape and no
pressure difference, there is no lift. Without lift, the boat stops
moving--and also cannot be steered, because it steers by drag on the rudder 
when in motion. 

This condition is called *head to wind* when directly at 
0 degrees, and evocatively, *in irons* when stalled within the +30
degree to -30 degree arc and without steering capability. With a remarkable
lack of poetry, modern sailing instruction calls that entire arc
the *no go zone*. There is no point of sail name because you are not
sailing, you are either drifting or stalled.

The closest one can get to the true wind direction and maintain
sail shape and headway is called *close hauled*. The angle at which
a boat can first become close hauled is how high it can *point*. 
This depends on many factors, including the shape of the sail and hull
and how the advanced controls are adjusted.

As the bow falls off the wind, the remaining points of sail are a
*close reach* at about 60 degrees, a *beam reach* near 90 degrees, a
*broad reach* around 135 degrees, and *running* [*before the wind*]
when past about 160 degrees.

Head to wind, close hauled, close reach, and a beam reach are
generally called *upwind* directions. A broad reach and running are
*downwind* directions. 

Going *higher* or *heading up* means turning more towards upwind
(which is upwards in the diagram as a mneumonic). Going *lower* or
*falling off* (the wind) means turning away from the wind, towards
downwind. When a puff arives, it is *lifting* the boat if it lets you
head up, and *heading* you if it forces you to turn down.  Sailing
*above* another boat is going between it and the wind, and sailing
*below* is passing so that they come between you and the wind.

I previously referred to these angles as relative to the *true wind*.
True wind is the direction that the wind is coming from, relative to
the fixed ground. Because the boat itself is moving, it does not
experience the true wind relative to itself. Instead, the boat's own
motion makes the wind feel as if it is from a different direction and
different strength. This *apparent wind* is what you feel when you
start bicycling on a day with no true wind--you feel breeze on your
face, because the air is moving relative to you even though it is
fixed relative to the ground.

When in irons, the apparent wind is the same as the true wind. As the
bow turns through close hauled, close reach, and then a beam reach,
the apparent wind shifts increasingly closer to the direction that the
boat is pointing. On a beam reach for a fast boat, the apparent wind
may be close to 45 degrees even though the true wind is still at 0
degrees.

As the bow falls off the true wind further to a broad reach and
finally running, the apparent wind rotates back towards the direction
of the true wind. However, for these downwind directions, the apparent
wind is lighter than the true wind because the boat's own motion is
cancelling it. This is why it it is impossible to sail faster than the
wind downwind.

As you can see from the diagram, a beam reach is the fastest point of
sail for most boats. It takes good advantage of apparent wind while
approximately aligning the sail's lift vector with the boat's heading.


Angle of Attack
===============================================================
The dominant sail control is generally the sheet, for adjusting
the angle of attack of the sail. Because the sail is an airfoil,
it needs to point into the apparent wind to function upwind. 

If the sheet is too tight, then the sail will create drag on the
inside, which stalls the sail and slows the boat. If the sheet is too
loose, then the sail will experience drag on the outside and collapse,
luffing.

Mainsail
--------------------------------------------------------------

When the mainsail is pointing into the apparent wind and correctly
trimmed, the _boom will be approximately pointing into the apparent
wind_. 

Do not adjust by pointing the boom. Instead adjust the sail by easing
out the sheet until the sail starts to luff, and then pulling it
back in slightly.

You can also read the flow of the wind across the sail from the 
telltales. When the inner and outer telltales are both flying back,
the sail has the correct angle of attack. If the outer telltales
are not flying, then there is not enough wind on the outside.
Ease the sheet to move the sail back into the wind. If the inner
telltales are not flying, then the sail is about to luff. Trim
the sheet back in a bit before it luffs. 

In light wind, you should be able to see the luff of the sail just
about to come in and start luffing when the sail is trimmed well.

Most people err by overtightening the sheet and stalling with too
large an angle of attack. It is very obvious when you're luffing,
but not as obvious when you're stalling. Thus, the rule of
thumb is "When in doubt, let it out."

When running, there is no lift from the sail. Instead, it is moved by
drag. In this case, adjust the mainsail to best catch the wind coming
from behind. The outer telltales are useless as they are completely in
the lee of the sail.


Headsails
----------------------------------------------------------------

The same goals apply for controlling the headsail's angle of attack.
However, when headsails are present they affect the apparent wind
on the main. The apparent wind on the main is slightly faster and from an angle closer to the boat's
heading than on the headsail, because wind must pass through the slot between them.

Thus with a headsail present you will end up tightening the mainsheet
slightly more than without one.

Headsails do not function well on the same side of the boat as the
main when running because they are also in the lee of the main. You
can pull the headsail over to the opposite side and sail *wing on
wing*. This helps balance the boat. You may have to grab the jib sheet
outside of the spreader and hold it far out and forward to make the
headsail full. On large boats there is a *whisker pole* for holding
the sail in that position.

When sailing with headsails, prefer adjusting them to adjusting the
main when there are small wind shifts. They are easier to move quickly
and are more affected because they experience apparent wind closer
to the true wind.


### Steering with sails



Other Sail Controls
=============================================================== 

The cunningham, vang, halyard, leech line, traveler, outhaul, jib car
position, and stay tension also adjust sail shape. I discuss these in
the [intermediate](intermediate.html) sailing notes.

When you are a novice for sail trim, set them as follows for the day
and avoid strong wind conditions that require adjusting these
controls:

- Traveler: Center.
- Vang: Just tight enough that the boom doesn't ride up in gusts
  when downwind. It will be very loose upwind.
- Halyard as tight as you can make it.
- Cunningham: On a light day, loose enough that there are a few wrinkles in 
  the luff when head to wind. On a windy day, tight.
- Outhaul: Leave the foot about 20 cm away from
  the boom on a dinghy when going upwind. For a larger
  boat with the foot attached to the boom the belly of 
  the sail should appear full.
- Jib cars: the sheet from car to clew should extend into a line
  that intersects the forestay halfway up. This is not half the
  angle between the foot and leech.
- Leech line: Just tight enough that the leech doesn't flap.
  Do not overtighten.

If you want to begin experimenting more, start with the traveler as it
is the easiest control to understand. The traveler lets you separate
the downward and inward pull of the mainsheet when sailing
upwind. Adjust it to keep the mainsheet roughly vertical until it goes
beyond the traveler track, at which point the traveler will be
released nearly to the end on that side. Avoid pulling the traveler
past halfway when close hauled.


Changing Tacks
===============================================================

Tacking
---------------------------------------------------------------
When the boat passes from close hauled on one tack through head to
wind to close hauled on another tack, the sail switches sides after
luffing and the maneuver is called *tacking*. 

Tacking is potentially
difficult to achieve if there is very strong or very light wind, in
which case the boat may not make it through the tack and can become
stuck in irons. It is generally considered safe because the sail
naturally loses power in the middle of the maneuver, so the forces
are minimized and easy to control. 

To avoid being stuck in irons when tacking, tack decisively with some
speed on. Move the rudder significantly and hold it in place until the
boat is accelerating on the new tack. In general, a boat loses
significant speed during a tack.

Gybing
---------------------------------------------------------------
When the boat passes from running on one tack to running on the other
tack, that is called a *gybe* (also spelled "jibe"). The sail never
luffs in this case. It is powered on one side and then suddenly
powered on the other side. 

Gybing is easy to accomplish because there is never any loss of
power. In fact, it is too easy. It is potentially dangerous because
there is never a natural reduction of force and the sail and boom can
come across the boat very fast and when the crew is unprepared.

To maintain control during a gybe, bring the mainsail into the center
of the boat just before turning the rudder. Then, ease it back out on
the new side, rather than letting it crash on its own. In light wind,
you can instead grab the mainsheet directly on the way to the boom and
move it from one side to the other to force the sail to gybe. When
gybing, the boat generally maintains speed.

Avoid a surprising crash gybe through vigilance when sailing downwind.
Attend to incoming changes of wind direction and continuously watch
the back edge of the sail to see if it is curling and about to move.
In very strong and changeable winds, avoid sailing directly downwind
entirely.

Fearless Gybes
------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no need to be afraid of gybing. Once you know how to depower
the mainsail using the sheet, vang, and cunningham you will always
be in control of your boat. Leverage that control to bring the main
across intentionally by throwing it in light wind and centering it
in heavy wind. 

In a small boat, if the conditions make you afraid to gybe then you
should return to shore. The maneuver should never be uncontrolled and
thus hard and dangerous. If it isn't safe to gybe, then it isn't safe
to sail. (Moreover, I've sailed many boats that are hard to tack in
high wind, so I _prefer_ to gybe to reverse direction in a small boat
in high wind to maintain speed and control. I will often do so near
the starting line in a race where losing speed or going into irons
would be catastrophic.)

If you're concerned about gybing in a large boat, that is a sign that
you need to reduced sail by reefing. Only in storm conditions with
exceptional wind and strong waves should it be necessary to fall back
on a "chicken gybe" by tacking around 270 degrees instead of gybing.

Depowering
===============================================================

An overpowered sailboat is not just hard to control and uncomfortable
to be on. It is also slow. There is no reason to sail overpowered.
When overpowered, there will be too much windward helm upwind. The
boat will heel far over, especially in gusts. (It will also heel too
much if the angle of attack is too steep because the sheet is too
tight; that isn't overpowered, that is just bad trim.)

When overpowered, the easiest control for depowering is to decrease
the angle of attack of the sails. Ease the sheet and intentionally
luff a little. Althought the sail will lose its beautiful curve, you
will have more control and actually move faster.

You can also achieve the same effect when close hauled by *pinching*
and pointing slightly higher than close hauled. The combination of
easing and pinching allows you to navigate gusts and higher winds.

Of course, trimming the sail too tightly also depowers the sail. But
it is generally not a good tactic because it causes excess heel, puts
more strain on all parts of the system (including your arm), and makes
it hard to know how depowered you are.
