                       **Novice Sail Trimming**
                         Updated 2022-12-27

This guide is for novice sailors. Ideally, you're comfortable sailing
a dinghy or small keelboat on your own as described in the
[10 Easy Steps](../learn/index.html) guide and are familiar with the
[Essential Rope Techniques](../rope/index.html). Now, you want to
improve your sail handling beyond intuition.

This guide is also good if you're crewing on a larger boat and want to
move beyond following the skipper's instructions to having some
autonomy in sail adjustment.

If already you've mastered the techniques in this article, then my
[intermediate trimming](intermediate.html) guide may be more appropriate.

There's a lot more to effective sailing than sail handling. Steering,
navigation, ballast management, mooring, rig adjustment, race
strategy, and boat maintenance are all key skills. However, if you're
day sailing in a small boat, or crewing for someone else, then sail
handling is one of the first skills you'll want independent ability
in.
