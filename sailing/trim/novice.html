This guide is for novice sailors. Ideally, you're comfortable sailing
a dinghy or small keelboat on your own as described in the
[10 easy steps](../learn/index.html) guide and want to improve your
sail handling beyond intuition. This guide is also good if you're
crewing on a larger boat and want to move beyond following the
skipper's instructions to some autonomy in sail adjustment.

If you've mastered the techniques in this article, then my
[intermediate trim](intermediate.html) guide may be more appropriate.

There's a lot more to effective sailing than sail handling. Steering,
navigation, ballast management, mooring, rig adjustment, race
strategy, and boat maintenance are all key skills. However, if you're
renting or borrowing a boat for day sailing or crewing on someone
else's boat, sail handling is one of the first skills you'll want
independent ability in.
