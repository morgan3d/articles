         **Virtual Reality First Experiences**
              2019-04-08
              
              
This article describes the software and hardware that I use to
introduce people to virtual reality. My goal is to create a good first
experience, as well as one worth returning to.  I also describe _why_
I find certain experiences to be particularly effective. Use this as a 
guide for seeking your own first VR experience, bringing others to VR for
the first time, investing in a VR room at home, or building a VR room 
for the public at a university, museum, or library.

!!!
   Short answer: go to a [The Void](https://www.thevoid.com/) installation
   or add to your Windows PC:
   - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 GPU
   - _Beat Saber_ and _Google Earth_ software
   - A used Oculus Rift (not the "S", "Quest", or "Go" model) with 3 sensors, or an HTC Vive
   ...or wait until June 15, 2019 and buy the [Valve Index](https://store.steampowered.com/sale/valve_index/).

There are many consumer virtual reality devices currently or about to
be available, including: GearVR, Oculus Go, Oculus Quest, HTC Vive,
HTC Vive Pro, Valve Index, Oculus Rift S, Oculus Rift, PSVR, Google
Daydream View, Switch Labo Vr, and Windows Mixed Reality
devices. There is even more software available across these, which
vary from "360 Video" to fully immersive, multiplayer environments.

The experiences across this range of software and hardware are far
from equal. They vary from life-altering, high quality moments to ones
that will not only underwhelm you, but will probably give you an
instant headache and twelve hours of nausea. Here's how to create
a first experience that is likely to be one of the good ones.

My recommendations are based on my professional background in video
game and virtual reality research as well as introducing thousands of
people to VR in many contexts. These are personal recommendations and
opinions, and not the position of any of my employers or organizations
that I'm associated with. As the state of VR is rapidly changing, I'll
regularly update my recommendations as well. My advice is restricted
to publicly information and devices, as I obviously can't comment on
experiences and information received under non-disclosure agreements.



VR Is Pro and Enthusiast
=====================================================================

There is not yet a sustainable casual VR market. You can't economize
on VR today and have a good experience. The software and hardware
vendors for low-cost VR have to make design choices that significantly
limit the experience, often to the point of discomfort.

So, unfortunately, if you've tried a PSVR, Daydream, or Oculus Go,
that does not represent the best state of VR. The teams behind those
products have done great work within extremely limiting economic and
technical constraints. But so have the folks making plastic-sealed
factory pastries. A Hostess CupCake at a filling station tells you
nothing about the experience of eating an Ã©clair in Paris. Many people
can have a good experience on these low-cost devices (and some can't),
but it is never a _great_ experience and for those unused to video 
games, the odds fall fast.

In contrast, the professional VR market is booming for doctors,
engineers, military, and similar applications. The enthusiast VR
market grew rapidly and appears saturated, however, it is a market in
which players are willing to upgrade frequently. Both pro and
enthusiast are about paying more for a better experience. The software
and hardware targeting those markets are expensive, but that cost
goes directly to getting you as close as possible to stepping into
a virtual world.


Installations
=====================================================================
![](thevoid.jpg)

Installation/location based entertainment/virtual theme parks are the one
place where low-cost consumer entertainment and pro/enthusiast quality
come together. 

The best possible experience that you can have today in virtual
reality is an installation by
[The Void](https://www.thevoid.com/). There are currently a handful in
major cities around the world. I expect them to expand quickly and
have similar companies emerge.

These combine the best-of-breed VR systems with a custom multiplayer
experience. They also provide a warehouse-sized room that lets you
walk freely through the experience, feeling real walls, wind, mist,
and heat that satisfy multiple senses.  Being in VR in large, real
space with other real people makes the experience real and meaningful
in a way that can't be replicated at home. This costs about the price
of a movie for a 15 minute vacation from reality.

Installation VR is are only low-cost for a single experience, of course.
If you're creating a VR arcade, experience center for a museum or library,
or home setup that you plan to spend a lot of time with, then the $1000
cost of upgrading a PC for the best quality of VR is relatively low
for the number of hours that you'll get from it.


GPU
=====================================================================
You need a Windows PC with a good GPU for a good VR experience. I
recommend at least a **GeForce GTX 1660** GPU (this is better and 
less expensive on the street than the GeForce 1060 listed as a 
recommended specification by headsets). 

The 1660 gets you to a pretty good experience for something like $250.
If you have an even better GPU, then you will have smoother
visuals, less pixel flickering, and overall a little more comfort.
That's because a better GPU is less likely to miss frames and can force
VR games to render at higher resolution than the headset and then filter
the images down. I use a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti in VR and it is amazing. But
the 1660 is definitely the sweet spot on price versus experience.


Headset
======================================================================
As of April 2019, the best overall headsets are:

- A used **Oculus Rift CV1** with touch controllers and three tracking cameras
- The **HTC Vive**

Configure your system for room-scale VR with a minimum 2 x 2 m^2
area. The difference between seated, standing, and full room-scale VR
is significant. You want room-scale.

Of these two headsets, I slightly prefer the Rift because it has
built-in headphones and more comfortable controllers. But it requires
four USB ports on your computer and the hand tracking often fails near
the floor or edges of the room. The Vive is a little more awkward but
tracking is flawless.  There are also a few games which are exclusive
to the Rift, although there is third-party software to work around
this limitation if you don't mind fiddling with configurations a bit.


![Valve Index](valveindex.jpg width=220px)
The **Valve Index** has been announced and will go on sale in 
June 2019.  It is likely to replace the HTC Vive with significantly
better resolution, field of view, controllers, and even lighter
weight. This looks like the successor to the Rift as a comfortable
and practical general VR device at the high end.


### Anti-recommendations

I don't recommend the **HTC Vive Pro** or **Vive Pro Eye**. The Vive
Pro has even better tracking than the Vive, better resolution, and
provides built-in headphones. But it is so heavy that it hurts many
people's necks even when used briefly. It actually isn't "Pro", since
as a professional user who spends hours in VR each day, I can't
physically afford to use it.

The Rift is discontinued, so it can only be
purchased used an in some retail locations that still have stock. It
will be replaced by the **Rift S**. Unfortunately for enthusiasts, the Rift S appears to
be about lowering cost instead of improving the experience. It lacks
some adjustments needed to fit different people's eyes. The resolution
is slightly higher than the original Rift, but the refresh rate is
also lower.

The **Varjo VR-1** is a true pro headset that is significantly more
expensive but has fantastic resolution and reasonable weight. It also
has an obvious discontinuity between the two screens for each eye that
makes it feel like you are wearing bifocals. It is really only
suitable for particular design applications and not general VR use.

The **Pimax** headsets have impressive specifications, but awkward form factors 
and limited support. Like Varjo, this has uses but is not a good
choice for an amazing first experience in VR.

I haven't found a high-quality **Windows Mixed Reality** (WMR) headset yet.
I'm impressed with what they achieve at their price point, but it isn't
in the same league with Vive and Rift.


First Run
=====================================================================

Acclimatize with _The Lab_
------------------------------------

![ ](thelab.jpg width=512px)

For regular game players in good health, I go straight to [_Beat Saber_](#_beatsaber_). For everyone else,
I start with
[_The Lab_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/450390/The_Lab/). It is
is free on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/).  It has many
pieces, but the essential three for getting acclimated to VR and
understanding some of the user interface conventions are:

1. "Postcards", which particularly essential to acclimate nongamers to the feeling of a digital display
and avatar,
2. "Robot Repair", a lightly interactive but fully-scripted narrative experience, and
3. "Slingshot", which is a simple game with great comic writing.

After those, take a break for a while. It can take a few hours of
total experience spread over a few days for your body to become
comfortable with even the best VR headsets. If you push it too far
then you'll just feel sick.

If you ever feel the onset of motion sickness, stop immediately.
Motion sickness is not something that you can "tough through". It will
build suddenly and leave you unwell for up to a day if you continue
when not comfortable.

Assuming that your VR experience in _The Lab_ was good, you can move
on to some of the best-designed VR software which allow a satisfying
experience that can be as short as 10 minutes or as long as you wish.


Flexible Experiences
------------------------------------------------------

These are experiences that have an impact and reveal their best parts
in as short a period as five minutes, but which you can happily spend
hours in if they particularly appeal to you. I recommend them all
without reservation.

Where software is available on both Steam and Oculus stores, I
recommend buying it on Steam. Steam offers better prices, guaranteed
refunds for games that you don't enjoy, somewhat-restricted library
sharing with others, and a great integrate friends system. Games
bought on Steam can generally be played on all PC VR systems, while
the Oculus store is restricted to Oculus hardware.

### _Google Earth_

![ ](GoogleEarth.jpg width=512px)
_Google Earth_ is available on both the [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/348250/Google_Earth_VR/) and
[Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1513995308673845/) stores.

This allows you to go anywhere that Google has map data and explore in
3D from a bird's eye view. Everyone seems to enjoy visiting familiar locations
from this new vantage point, as well as exploring fantasy destinations.

The software has a number of built-in design and rendering decisions
that make it very comfortable even for first-time VR users. Because it literally
covers the globe, there's more content than you could experience in a lifetime.
The experience moves at your own pace and allows you to spend as much or as
little time as you wish.


### _Beat Saber_

![ ](BeatSaber.jpg width=512px)
_Beat Saber_ is available on both the
[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/620980/Beat_Saber/) and
[Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1304877726278670/) stores.

While it looks like a sword fighting game, this is really an
interative music video, arcade video game, and dance aerobic workout
all in one.

This is the most comfortable and intutive VR game I've found. The
content is appropriate for all ages, although the music is likely
to appeal to younger sensitivilities.

It is still a game, so it is maybe best as a first experience
for people with some arcade game experience and reasonable balance
and conditioning. 


### _Superhot VR_

![ ](SuperhotVR.jpg width=512px)
[best on Rift because the grip and firing controls are more natural]

[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/617830/SUPERHOT_VR/) and
[Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1012593518800648/) stores. 

If you saw _The Matrix_, this is the closest current equivalent to its
combat mechanics. In a room-scale setting with good 360 degree
tracking it is amazing for anyone who enjoys action movies. 

Although stylized, the content is clearly
hyperviolent and only appropriate for certain audiences.

Its unique bullet-time mechanic is the reason that _Superhot_ works so
much better than all other combat VR games. Time only moves when you
do, so if you hold still or move slowly, you can slow the pace of
interaction.  This allows you to move at a speed that feels
comfortable and avoids any confusion or time pressure. 

There's also no player-controlled locomotion. You automatically
teleport through the levels when you've defeated the enemies in each
scene.


### _Tilt Brush_

![ ](TiltBrush.jpg width=512px)
_Tilt Brush_ is available on both the
[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/327140/Tilt_Brush/) and
[Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1111640318951750/) stores.

There are a number of 3D paint and modeling programs. This seems
to be the one that is the most comfortable for most users and inspires
instant and playful creative exploration. For children,
I found this superior to Google Earth and Superhot, and less stressful
than Beat Saber.



Extended Games

[Rift exclusive]
