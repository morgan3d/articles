         **Virtual Reality Experiences**
              An Introduction
              
              
This article describes the experiences I use to introduce people to virtual reality, which
includes some of the ones I keep coming back to myself. I have some specific recommendations
and will keep updating the article as new experiences become available. However, more
importantly, I describe _why_ I find certain experiences to be particularly effective due their
software design.

There are many consumer virtual reality devices currently available, including GearVR, Oculus
Go, HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, PSVR, Google Daydream, and Windows Mixed Reality devices that are
flooding the market. There are even more software experiences available across these, which
vary from "360 Videos" to fully immersive, multiplayer experiences. They are far from equal.
These vary from life-altering high quality moments to ones that will not only underwhelm you,
they'll probably give you an instant headache and 12 hours of nausea.


Software
====================================

For all of the software that I recommend in this section, I'm assuming that you're using HTC
Vive Pro (with at least a 2m x 2m area to move in) or Oculus Rift (using hand controllers and
at least two tracking cameras in a 2m x 2m area), on a Windows PC with at least a GeForce 1070
GPU. I explain some of the tradeoffs between these systems, why I recommend these two,
and how to get access to them later in the Hardware section.


Acclimatize with _The Lab_
------------------------------------

Everyone should start with [_The Lab_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/450390/The_Lab/), 
which is free on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/).  It has many
pieces, but the essential three for getting aclimated to VR and understanding some of the user interface
conventions are:

1. "Postcards", which particularly essential to acclimate nongamers to the feeling of a digital display
and avatar,
2. "Robot Repair", a lightly interactive but fully-scripted narrative experience, and
3. "Slingshot", which is a simple game with great comic writing.

After those, take a break for a while. It can take a few hours of total experience spread over
a few days for your body to become comfortable with even the best VR headsets. If you push it too far
you'll just feel sick. And if you ever feel the onset of motion sickness, stop immediately. 
Motion sickness is not something that you can tough through. It will build suddenly and leave you
unwell for up to a day if you continue when not comfortable.

Assuming that your VR experience in _The Lab_ was good, you can move on to some of the best-designed
VR software which allow a satisfying experience that can be as short as 10 minutes or as long as you wish.


Flexible Experiences
------------------------------------------------------

These are experiences that have an impact and reveal their best parts in as short a period as
five minutes, but which you can happily spend hours in if they particularly appeal to you. I
recommend them all without reservation. 

Where software is available on both Steam and Oculus stores, I recommend buying it on
Steam. Steam offers better prices, guaranteed refunds for games that you don't enjoy,
somewhat-restricted library sharing with others, and a great integrate friends system. Games
bought on Steam can generally be played on all PC VR systems, while the Oculus store is
restricted to Oculus hardware.

### _Google Earth_

_Google Earth_ is available on both the [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/348250/Google_Earth_VR/) and
[Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1513995308673845/) stores.

### _Beat Saber_

_Beat Saber_ is available on both the
[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/620980/Beat_Saber/) and
[Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1304877726278670/) stores.
I prefer to play it on Vive Pro because that system has slightly better tracking and much better controller weight
for this game, but the experience is great on both platforms.


### _Superhot VR_

Hardware
=========================================

VR is a clear case of getting what you pay for. A top of the line HTC Vive Pro or Oculus Rift
setup costs about US$4000, including the software and graphics card and not including the 4m x
4m room you have to somehow find and install cables all over. This costs 20x as much as the
lowest-end VR hardware, but the experience is 1000x better. If you're a VR enthusiast, then you
should upgrade your gaming PC and then buy a Rift or Vive. It will be worth it to you. 

Should you buy a Rift or Vive Pro for your PC? Their upsides and downsides balance out. I
prefer Rift right now because the controllers are *much* better and the headset is lighter (and
cooler). And, as much as I hate to reward Oculus for platform lock-in and a terrible store experience, there are some
experiences that are only available on Oculus Rift right now, so that makes Rift more valuable to consumers. SteamVR supports all PC headsets, and almost all
games on all headsets. However, the Vive Pro tracking is far superior, so I use it for experiences that have room-scale
wandering. The Vive Pro's resolution boost is hard to appreciate; good antialiasing from a
high-quality GPU is more important.

But Vive is about to release an improved controller that will likely nudge it above Rift...and
Rift is overdue for a refresh. I'll update this article as new hardware appears, but I think
they're currently about even overall and about to stay there.  Both are incredibly finicky
about USB ports and drivers, so expect some PC-gamer level pain for the installation and
maintenance.

If you're just curious about VR, then you should try a VR arcade that uses Rift or Vive (with
two wands/controllers in your hands, and that lets you stand and walk around at least a
little). The low-priced standalone or mobile-phone based VR headsets that you might receive as a
gift or find at a film festival or conference are interesting, but they are a completely different
experience. Don't start there if you want to see the potential of VR.

The best possible experience that you can have today in virtual reality is an installation by
[The Void](https://www.thevoid.com/). There are currently a handful in big cities, and I expect
them to expand quickly and have similar companies emerge. These couple the best-of-breed VR
systems with a custom multiplayer experience. Most significantly, they provide a
warehouse-sized room that lets you walk freely through the experience, feeling real walls,
wind, mist, and heat that satisfy multiple senses. This costs about the price of a movie for a
15 minute vacation from reality. This is as close as you can get to a living dream or being in
"The Matrix" today.

PSVR and the Windows Mixed Reality experience are somewhere between the PC enthusiast
experience of the Rift or Vive and the mobile headsets. They are suprisingly good, but whether
you enjoy them or not, you still haven't experienced the absolute best of today's technology.
