   **Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination**

In April 2019, this page will contain details on implementing Dynamic
Diffuse Global Illumination (DDGI) using ray-traced irradiance probes
with visibility.

The technique was first presented at GTC'19 and GDC'19 in the NVIDIA
sponsored sessions. It will be published in a peer-reviewed research
paper by Majercik et al. in JCGT with our academic collaborators at
McGill and the University of Montreal and presented for an academic
audience at I3D'19 in May.

Game developers can contact Morgan McGuire <mcguire@nvidia.com> @CasualEffects
for more information in the mean time.
