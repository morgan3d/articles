      **Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination**
           2019 April 4

Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination (DDGI) is a technique for computing
diffuse lighting with ray tracing to create changing, realistic rendering
for games. It allows developers to extend their existing light probe
tools, knowledge, and experience with ray tracing to eliminate bake
times and avoid light leaking.

DDGI was first presented at GTC'19 and GDC'19 in the NVIDIA sponsored sessions. 
You can [see the video online](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1026182/).
It is described in a peer-reviewed research paper,

>  Zander Majercik, Jean-Phillipe Guertin, Derek Nowrouzezhrai, and Morgan McGuire,
>  **Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination with Ray-Traced Irradiance Probes**,
>  Journal of Computer Graphics Tools, April 2019 (to appear)

with our academic collaborators at McGill and the University of Montreal, 
which I'll present for an academic audience at [I3D'19](http://i3dsymposium.github.io/2019/) 
in May.

Next week, I'll update this page with implementation details from the talk.
Game developers can contact Morgan McGuire <mcguire@nvidia.com> / [@CasualEffects](https://twitter.com/CasualEffects)
for more information in the mean time.
